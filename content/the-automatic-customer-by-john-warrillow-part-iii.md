The why and the what is covered - onto the how.

# The Automatic Customer

> _"The moment you switch to a subscription model your P&L will start to look ugly."_

P&L = Profit and Loss. The amount of money one makes after one pays expenses and the cost to make what is being sold. In subscription businesses, one's renting access to a product or service over time.

> _"The foundation of your subscription business is built on your monthly recurring revenue (MRR)."_

Membership Price / 12 = MRR rate

> _"The next number you need to understand is the lifetime value (LTV) of a subscriber."_

Number of months customer stays on x MRR = LTV

> _"The next data point you need to assess the health of your subscription business is your customer acquisition cost (CAC)."_

Cost of sales and marketing / Number of subscribers acquired = CAC

Warrillow points out that the earliest subscribers are likely "love and guilt" ones - family and friends. Those need to be discounted to get a true CAC.

On sales channels, Warrillow explains varying options. The most interesting one (to me) is _Self-Serve_. With the example of Ancestry.com, self-serve is a sale strategy which uses no outbound salespeople, but instead  relies on marketing copy and videos to explain their offering.

> _"\[...] the CAC payback period measures how many months it takes you to make back the cost of acquiring a customer."_

CAC Payback Period = Total Sales and Marketing Costs for a Month / New MRR added for the Month
