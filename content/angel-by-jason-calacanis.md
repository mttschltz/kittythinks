Two things I find interesting: How businesses succeed and how other people make money.\
This book concerns angel investing, the early stage of raising cash for startups.

In the fashion of previous business book summaries, I will keep this to the point, for easy perusing.

_Founding Rounds for Businesses (rarely all observed):_

* _Sweat Equity_ = founders work or free
* _Bootstrapping_ = money found outside o investors (e.g. clients willing to finance product)
* _Friends & Family_
* _Self-funding_
* _Incubator Funding =_ 5-10% seed funding (25k-150k)
* **_Seed/Angel Funding_ = usually after 2/3 rounds above**
* _Bridge Round/Seed Plus_ = angel money runs out before the company qualifies for Series A
* _Series A_ = usually done by professional venture capital firm
* _Series B-F & Mezzanine Rounds_ = usually far removed from angel investing

_For Whom Angel Investing Is:_

Angel investing is done for businesses **less than three years** old, with **no traction**, which are **looking for product or market fit**.

If a business has achieved monetization, it is either bought by a bigger company or it goes public. Both of these outcomes, which are giving investors a return on their money, are known as **exit**.

Other potential outcomes are so called **acquihires**, in which a company is acquired specifically to hire it's talent, and **unicorn** companies which manage to get a value of 1 billion USD.

_Angel Skills:_

1. _Money _(have it)
2. _Time _(give it)
3. _Network _(connect them)
4. _Expertise_ (teach them)
5. _People Skills _(read them)
