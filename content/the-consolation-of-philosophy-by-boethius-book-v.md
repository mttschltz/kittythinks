## The Consolation of Philosophy - Book V

Boethius is very close to understanding it all. He has a few, fundamental questions left.

_Does chance actually exist?_

No, chance is nothing, Philosophy says. If chance is defined as random motions instead of sequences of events, it cannot exist. Nothing comes from nothing, all comes from something (namely, providence). Even accidents are not chance.

An accident presumes a sequence of events. One finds a pot of gold when digging for potatoes? That presumes one dug somewhere and someone buried gold. In consequence, 'chance' is simply an unexpected result of an action that was done for some other purpose.

_Does providence constrain free will then?_

Free will exists, because it is necessary for humans' ability to act rationally. The tilt to goodness (and thus, to god), requires a person to understand what is desirable and to avoid what is not. This reasoning ability presuppose free will.

Free will however, can be inhibited. In fact, those most enslaved, are those who have abandoned reason in favour of vices. They could have chosen otherwise however, due to their free will.

_But how can god know everything that will happen and still, there is free will?_

Even if an event is foreseen, it does not occur _because_ it is foreseen. Foreknowledge does not necessitate what will happen.

For example: at a horse race, you have foreknowledge on what is going to happen (RACING!), yet, no race _must_ necessarily occur!
