## The Ming's Beginning

Prior to 1363, China was a Mongolian vassal. This changed with one man:  Zhu Yuanzhang (1328-1398). Zhu was a poor novice monk who had been orphaned early on. He had seen the devastation that foreign rule could cause (namely famines and uprisings) and decided to join a rebel group to initiate change.

Within five years, the Mongol rule was over.

Zhu's ambition was the restructuring of China, and he started with revitalising the agricultural landscape. Countless trees were planted (estimations say 1 billion mulberry trees, orchards and trees for shipbuilding in just 20 years), arable land cultivated and suplied with water and the income from grain tripled.

## Pre-Trump America

The USA has been famously successful in commerce, science, entertainment... all things that make a country a powerhouse. There were hiccups up surely, but by and large, the US was ever forward facing.

Until Donald John Trump announced his candidacy for president in June 2015.

## Insularity as a Trauma Response

The emperor, who would choose the name Hóngwǔ ("vastly martial"), could not forget his disdain for those who did not fight against the Mongols, so he created a regime that was absolutist. Personnel were executed on mere suspicion of disloyalty, and all ministries were to report directly to and through him.

Hóngwǔ wanted an orderly society, and the simplest way was by caste. He classified people into soliders (a category especially important to him), farmers and merchants, with separatly assigned settlements and tax classes. People were not to change jobs and settled area and that was meant to be overseen by officials. 

There weren't enough officials to control everything and soon the tax income looked disjointed.

Especially the solider class proved problematic. Soldiers were meant to be born into their job - without considerations for predilection to the task. There was also no military budget, instead land was set aside which the solider class was meant to use for their survival. \
Wealthier solider quickly used the land as their freehold and made younger and poorer soliders work their land. They also removed themselves from active duty by paying poorer soliders to fight in their stead. Many also simply deserted.

Zhu, whose rebellious beginnings had to be counteracted by an appeal to the Confucian elite, faced issues due to their philosophical attitudes too. Confucians had a disdain for trade. While China did not succumb to full isolationism as Japan had, it turned inward spiritually. 

This new insular mentality led to conservatism in all of society, and was soon followed by trade restrictions. An incident with Japanese smugglers even led to drastic measures (the destruction of all seafaring vessels) and yet, it had little effect.

Thus, is 1551, all foreign trade was forbidden.

16 years later, all restriction were reversed as they had led the opposite outcome.

## Insularity as Revenge?

When Trump became president of the USA, he gave no one illusions about his stance. "Make America Great Again" is a clear non-interventionist motto. Trump's America is meant to be about itself, not foreign problems. 

On the surface, non-interventionism is not a bad policy. To grant that other nations have the ability and should therefore be granted the right to self-determine is the basis of many countries' international policy. 

However, when coupled with Trump's protectionism (an economic policy that assumed that the restricting, often through tarriffs, of foreign trade will increase a country's revenue and domestic product), and his appeal to conservative attitudes fueled by American-branded Christianity, one quickly arrives at an isolationist reality. 

Trump's intentions are based on his experience as a business mogol and perhaps the Monroe Doctrine of early America. This policy from 1823, sought to stop European interference in the US on the threat of unknown measures. This policy has been in effect in the US at various time and to various degrees ever since. It is an imperial idea, a hegemony of the US over others.

To Trump, the Monroe Doctrine extends over all of the Western hemisphere.

## You can Count, but not Count On, Money

Zhu had no interest in any economic venture but agriculture. This wasn't odd given his background, but it made him inflexible to progress and blind to the realities of what is needed for economic growth. \
He sat his taxes very low, and assumed that people would not jerk their duties based on Confucian morality. His son echoed his attitudes and future emperors, despite changing times and new, often internal foes (wealthy landowners, scheming eunuchs, etc.), were unable to change the overreliance on agriculture and low taxes.

In the 16th century, there was an economic upturn, partially attributed to outside influences (silver from Portugal and Spain, sweet potato and potato from Latin Ameria, technological advancements, etc.), and partially due to a simplification of taxes. 

But the damage was done regardless, as the conservative, inward mentalities had not changed. 

This new economic boom was based on new inventions and silver, not on agricultural achievements. In fact, the value of agricultural products fell from 100 ounces of silver in 1500 to just 2 ounces of silver by 1700.

And yet, the mentality on what constitutated the basis of growth didn't keep up with the new realities and farmers were expected to pay more (in coin and grain). They couldn't however, as the money was with merchants in cities.

Eventually, farmers in prominent provinces rose up and due to the serious overspending of the imperial household (on itself and wars), soliders who had since been paid instead of being forced into their class, could not be afforded.

Consequently, the farmer revolts - together with attacks from the Manchus of Northern China - led to the fall of the Ming Dynasty in April 1644 when Chóngzhēn, the last Ming emperor, hung himself.
