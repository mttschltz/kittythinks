The Consolation of Philosophy - Book III

Boethius has stopped worrying about punishment and is eager for Lady Philosophy to educate him further.

His new goal is to understand ultimate happiness.

What everyone wants, is to be happy. Happiness is thus the supreme good, summum bonum.

We go about obtaining happiness in varying ways. 

Happiness is to not want, thus seeking wealth, is happiness. Through effort, one may be happy to obtain honour. To seek power is better than to be weak. Most excellent things are famous, so to seek fame is happiness. Happiness is to not be in pain or troubled, thus seeking pleasure is happiness.

Humans are hazy on how to achieve summum bonum, so they make the mistake of only trying for one of those things that make one happy. 

Wealth promises self-sufficiency, but to protect wealth, one must depend on others for protection. Those rich are also still wanting. They may be able to buy warm clothes and food, but they are still getting cold and hungry. Thus, wealth cannot obliterate need, it can only make it easier to bear.

Honour promises a lack of venality (being likely to accept bribes), however, high offices that carry honour highlight the defects of bad man that otherwise would have gone unnoticed and they also taint the office, making people hate the office and thus the holder. Thus, only respectable people can make high offices honourable.
