# THE SUMMONER

* **Friar** - a man scorned
* **Thomas** - a humorous one
* **Lord** - missing the point
* **Jenkins** - genius

There's a **friar** who has no problem begging. 

One day he goes to sick **Thomas** and annoys him with talk of wrath and greed.

**Thomas** decides to offer the **friar** a donation, if he swears to share it with every other friar.

It is agreed and **Thomas** directs the **friar** to just put his hand behind his bottom, and he will find his donation.

**Thomas** farts on the **friar**'s hand.

The **friar** goes to complain to the **lord**. The **lord** however, is only wondering about the logistics - how does one divide a fart in 13? (The number of brothers in a mendicant order.)

**Jenkins**, a squire, overhears the conversation and has the solution: A cartwheel is to the placed in the hall. The 12 friars of the order are to kneel in front, noses to the spokes. The good **friar** who got the gift first, shall put his nose through the axe-hole.

Then **Thomas** is to fart through the opposite side of the axe-hole, giving the good **friar** the first sniff and all the others some too.

# THE CLERIC

_Disclaimer: This story is interesting in that it is hardcore even for medieval standards. The tale-tellers all agree that women should not have to prostrate themselves to this extreme._

* **Walter** - a terrible person
* **Griselda** - a tortured woman

**Walter**, a Marquis has finally decided to take a wife. He decides on **Griselda**, the poorest villager around.

She proves to be the perfect wife and quickly bears a daughter.

Walter wants to test **Griselda**'s loyalty and takes the child away and tells **Griselda** he killed her.

Four years later, **Griselda** is pregnant again and bears a son. **Walter** decides to again pretend he murdered the child.

Thereafter, he devices a new test. He writes the Pope to get an annulment and sends for his children. He tells **Griselda** that her status is too low and he will marry a 12 year old.

He strips **Griselda** of everything but a peasant dress and sends her back to her village.

When the marriage draws nearer, **Walter **cruelly summons **Griselda** to prepare the wedding night suite. 

Walter asks **Griselda** if she likes his new bride (who is actually their daughter) and **Griselda** praises her beauty and asks her ex-husband to please be kinder to his new wife than he was to her.

**Walter** now finally stops his charade.
