This is a tiny glimpse into the 1776 magnum opus _The Wealth of Nations_.\
Adam Smith is the shining head of the free market theory. To understand his intent, a quick economics lessons.

Between the 16th to the 18th century, the de jour economic theory was that of mercantilism. A nation, the mercantilist supporter would argue, is only as good as its economics self-sufficiency and its ability to export access goods. To achieve such a a thing, a nation must have a large population, build new houses and industries, accumulate enough gold, silver and other precious metal and promote local agriculture. 

To do this, a nation (apart from having natural resources and people) needs to regulate every aspect of  its industries through tariffs.

_The problem_: mercantilism evidently led to restrictive trade, inflation and war. (...and the slave trade)

Adam Smith looked at the state of his home country and draw simple conclusions. If people were not forced to produce and not forbidden to trade, their own self-interest would propel them to take up an industry they were best at and compete with their fellow people. This competition would lead to a richer, better nation.

The rulers should only care about protection - both from violence of other nations and from injustices committed by members of their own society, and about public maintenance, such as infrastructure and similar public institutions.

This was a revolutionary thought and often satirized in his own day. Today, economists see Smith as the father of the free market theory and he is often heralded as THE guy for defenders of capitalism.

_I would like to point out however, that Smith actually ended up working, in his later years, in the office which controlled the very tariffs he so disliked, and he was an advocate for public education, making him a sympathizer of capitalism but not a laissez-faire economist._
