# THE SQUIRE

* **Cambiuskan** - a king
* **Elpheta** - a queen
* **Algarsyf & Cambalo** - princes
* **Canace** - a princess
* **Knight** - a messenger
* **Falconess** - a betrayed one

On the birthday of king **Cambiuskan**, a strange knight appears and bears gifts from the kings of Arabia and India.

There is a magic flying horse made of brass, a sword that can kill and heal, a fortune-telling mirror, and a ring that makes the wearer understand birds and know herbs.

The next morning, **Canace** wears the magic ring and takes a walk. She comes upon a **falcones**s that had been betrayed by a kite. 

**Canace** takes her in and tends to her wounds...

# THE FRANKLIN

* **Arveragus** - a honourable knight
* **Dorigen** - a faithful woman
* **Aurelius** - a goodhearted fool
* **Magician** - a forgiven soul

**Arveragus** is married to **Dorigen**. The only thing he asked her on their wedding was to respect his position of honour.

When **Arveragus** goes off to war, Aurelius, a squire, tries to woo **Dorigen**. 

She is not interested and tells him he only has a chance if he removes the black rocks on the coast from her sight.

**Aurelius** finds a **magician** and for £1000, he will make an illusion which remove the rocks.

When **Arveragus** comes back, the distraught **Dorigen** tells her of her unfortunate vow.

**Arveragus** decides that **Dorigen** must honour her vow.

When **Aurelius** realizes how reluctant **Dorigen **is and how honourable **Arveragus**, he changes his mind and lets the two be.

**Aurelius** is now broke and wifeless.

When the **magician **sees the selflessness of all three, he decides to waive the fee.

# THE PHYSICIAN

* **Virginius **- a serious knight
* **Virginia** - a victim of patriarchy
* **Appius** - a lawless judge
* **Claudius** - a fool

**Virginius** and his wife take their 14 year old daughter **Virginia** to worship.

**Appius**, sees the girl and wants her.

He hires **Claudius** to make a complaint against **Virginus** to the court.

**Claudius** claims that **Virginia** isn't **Virginus**'s child at all, but a slave baby stolen from him.

**Appius**, being the judge, decrees that **Virginia** must be given back to **Claudius** at once.

**Virginus** decides that **Virginia**'s honour must be preserved. He kills her.

The townspeople smell a ruse and confront **Appius**. 

**Appius** is thrown in jail, where he kills himself and **Claudius** is exiled.

_"For no matter whether he is an ignorant man or a learned man, he does not know how soon he shall be brought to fear."_
