_There are a lot of books about Roman history. The topic is one of the most popular ones, even among people who have only a cursory interest in history. However, many history books suffer from 'lecture syndrome', in which they simply state the progression of events, or they are opinion pieces that do not age well._

_This book is different. It takes aspects of Roman life and examines them from a factual, social, and philosophical perspective. _

_I will summarise those parts of the book that made me go "huh!"._
