# CHAPTER XII - The Hundred Years' War - Part II

The 15th century shoes a marked decline in English history. No great literature is being written, clergy are now more statesmen than scholars and due to the fruitless war with France, commerce is slow. 

Until the end of Richard II.'s reign, England had enjoyed steady progress, but now, governing lies in the hands of a few noble families who are battling among themselves to be the ruling party.

Richard II. has been disposed in favour of Henry IV.; Henry has been elected and thus, has to rule by advice of ministers and Parliament. This type of rule was named the "Lancastrian experiment in constitutional government" by later scholars.

It will prove to be inhibiting and Henry IV. is plagued by rebels throughout his reign.

At age 26, Henry V. succeeds his father to the throne. He is wildly popular; a serious king with a sense of duty.

His seriousness leads to the assumption that he is the rightful king of France - furthermore, a combining of the English and French forces would make him strong enough against is true enemy, the Lollards, followers of Catholic critic, John Wycliffe.

In 1415, he attempts to take back all of France and resurges the Hundred Year's War.

He picked a good time; Charles VI. of France is weakened by mental illness and the French princes are quarreling for the regency.

He takes his 15000 men to the small town of Harfleur - unexpectedly, the town holds out for months and the English soldiers are hard-hit by dysentery. He is left with some 7000 men.

Is late October 1415, Henry is making his way to Agincourt when the French forces interrupt him. Battle swiftly follows.

Land-wars were fought in groups, those were called 'battles'. Both the English and the French use three battles each. While the French lines their battles up in three rows, the English march theirs in a single line. 

On the end of each battle, Henry's forces have placed archers, they make up the highest number of soldiers. The French instead, are heavy in men-at-arms with lances and armoured knights.

The English attack first, with a quick counterattack by the French. Henry halts his forces and orders the archers to fix wooden stakes into the ground.

The French advance with their cavalry front-line, followed by their men-at-arms - both are shot down by the bowmen of on the English side and when both battles fall, the English soldiers climb on the dead French to go get the living with hatchets.

The third French battle flees and the English have won victoriously.

Due to the unlikely odds, and the rousing success, the Battle of Agincourt will become legendary.

France is crippled and in 1419, Henry V. finally takes Normandy.
