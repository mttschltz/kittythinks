**Story**

Hermes arrives in Delphi to announce that Creusa, daughter of King Erechtheus, has been found raped by Apollo. She fell pregnant and bore a son. She left the baby in the cave she was raped in, hoping it would die.

Hermes is tasked by his brother Apollo, to save the baby and lie him at Apollo's temple entrance. The child thus grows up as temple guardian.

When Creusa and her husband Xuthus conveive no children, Xuthus goes to Apollo's temple and meets Ion. Apollo tells Xuthus that the child is his. \
Creusa too comes to the temple soon after and openly weeps. When ask by the Chorus, she cryptically tells of the wickedness of the gods. When Creusa wants to speak to Apollo, she has to do so through Ion. She asks for Apollo to tell her what might have befallen the child. Ion is reluctant to ask his master, for he knows that Apollo does not like his honour hurt.

Meanwhile, Xuthus arrives. Creusa quickly wants to know if her and her husband will have any children together. Xuthus, now in the know about Ion, tells his wife that they won't return home childless.

Ion, conflicted still about Creusa's accusation towards Apollo, is starting to question his faith.
