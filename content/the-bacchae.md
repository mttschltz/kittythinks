**Story**

The god Dionysus, also known as Bacchus, is come and describes his background. He is Zeus' son but rumors abound in Thebes, his mother's birthplace, that he is but the son of a mortal. In anger, he has turned all the disbelieving women of Thebes into frenzied Bacchants, dancing in the mountains to his tune.\
In Thebes rules king Pentheus, son of Cadmus. He is cousin to Dionysus, but believes the rumors of his inferior birth. Dionysus is determined to show that he is who he says he is.
