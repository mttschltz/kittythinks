This is a bit of a different topic and summary style. #BreakIntoVC by Bradley Miles is a book about how to think specifically like a venture capitalist and generally like an investor. It targets newcomers who plan to interview for VC jobs. I summarize this book in a three part style, with questions and answers. 

## "VC" - _SUPER SUMMARY_ Part I

_What is a venture capitalist? _

The answer is an investor who receives money from different sources, who did not directly own a percentage of a portfolio company.

_How does venture capital investing work?_

There are different stages of capital raising in the lifespan of a company.

A new company raises money and spends it for 3-5 years to invest in their business idea. Then a further 5 years for pensions and return. Once 75% of the capital is invested, new funds get raised. This will happen about 5-7 years into the life of the company.

The average VC stage amounts to $400 million. The average VC deal size is $18 million.

_I'm already a functioning company, what comes next?_
