# CHAPTER XI - Chaucer, Wycliffe, and the Reign of Richard II.

England in the 14th century was still highly dependent on the peasantry and their labour.

Most peasants are still villeins, but they are becoming more free. Instead of labouring for their lord alone, many are now paying rent for a section of their lord's land, working for themselves too.\
By settling in a borough for 1 year and 1 day, a villeins' son would become free. The freed son may become a merchant or mayor, even even acquire an education by joining a monastery.

However, these good times come to an abrupt end in 1348, with the outbreak of the Black Death. The plague would go on to kill 70% of the English population, reducing its number from seven million to just two.

Immediately, there is now an extreme labour shortage.

Of course, the remaining labourers expected doubled wages, but Parliament quickly passes the 'Statue of Labourers", requiring wages to be the same as they had been prior to the plague outbreak.

This leads to resentment - so much so that the law is largely ignored and employers themselves offer higher wages to those labourers, leading to an increased production of food and higher prices.

In 1381, the poorly handled situation (plus the collecting of massive taxes) culminates in the Peasant Revolt. 1500 peasants would lose their lives.
