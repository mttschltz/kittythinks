## The Consolation of Philosophy - Book IV

Why is evil? Why are their wicked people if all tends to goodness?

Philosophy tries to explain why evil is not a relevant concept. Goodness is powerful (it is god after all), so wickedness is weak. Any human action presumes two things: there is will and there is ability.

If a person fails to do something, they lacked the ability to get what they have wanted. If one achieves to do something, the had the ability to get what they are wanted. The former person was weak and the latter was strong. Human will is, as Lady Philosophy as already explained, tilted towards happiness and since happiness is goodness, those who seek happiness, seek goodness.

It follows, that both good people and evil people seek happiness and thus, goodness.

While both seek the same, only good people obtain goodness, and thus are powerful, while evil people failed to obtain goodness and thus, are weak.

It can be said, Philosophy concludes further, that those who go against their nature by abandoning themselves through pursuing evil instead of their naturally inclined tilt to goodness, cease to exist.

This leads to the conclusion that wicked people are miserable and deserve our pity, since they eventually (when achieving what they think their desire), they realize they are not happy and have achieved nothing at all.

How to help the wicked then?

Punishment. If the wicked get punished, they in fact gain some good! 

Then why do people not see it this way? The average person would think punishment is always bad. Philosophy answers with an allusion to blindness:

> _"Ordinary people don't look up at the stars."_
