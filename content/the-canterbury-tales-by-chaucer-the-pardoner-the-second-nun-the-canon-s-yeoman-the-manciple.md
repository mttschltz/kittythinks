# THE PARDONER

* **Three rioters** - a bunch of questionable characters
* **Death** - the grimmest of reapers
* **Old man** - an innocent bystander

**Three** man get drunk in a bar. They hear that a man was slain by **Death** and decide to go sly **Death** themselves.

When they meet an **old man**, they berate him until they get told **Death** can be found by an old oak up the road.

When they arrive, they find 8 florins instead (worth ~ US$ 1.210 in April 2018) and forget all about **Death**.

Transporting this much money would brand them thieves, so they decide to wait until nightfall. To pass the time, they need refreshments. After drawing straws, the youngest of the group is sent.

The **two** left now plot the murder of the **third** upon his return. The **one** sent plots too and decides to poison their drinks. He gets three bottles of wine and poisons two.

Upon his return, the **two** kill the third swiftly and to celebrate their riches, drink the poisoned wine and die on the spot.

After finishing his story, the Pardoner tries to sell false relics to the Host, making his point.

_"You would make me kiss your old breaches, and swear they were the relic of a saint though they were foully stained by your bottom! But by the cross that St. Helen found, I wish I had your testicles in my hand instead of relics or holy objects. Cut them off, I'll help you carry them. They shall be enshrined in hog's dung!"_
