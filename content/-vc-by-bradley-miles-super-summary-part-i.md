This is a bit of a different topic and summary style. #BreakIntoVC by Bradley Miles is a book about how to think specifically like a venture capitalist and generally like an investor. It targets newcomers who plan to interview for VC jobs. I summarize this book in a three part style, with questions and answers. 

## "VC" - _SUPER SUMMARY_ Part I

_What is a venture capitalist? _

The answer is an investor who receives money from different sources, who did not directly own a percentage of a portfolio company.

_How does venture capital investing work?_

There are different stages of capital raising in the lifespan of a company.

A new company raises money and spends it for 3-5 years to invest in their business idea. Then a further 5 years for pensions and return. Once 75% of the capital is invested, new funds get raised. This will happen about 5-7 years into the life of the company.

The average VC stage amounts to $400 million. The average VC deal size is $18 million.

What are the stages of a company, capital-wise?

A company typically starts either with an Incubator (a private investor, or straight away with an Angel Investment. The difference between those two early investments lie in the expectations of the investors. While an Incubator essentially invests on good faith alone, an Angel Investor expects at least a theoretically viable idea.

After this stage, Venture Capital is needed. After this point, the company can be expected to be viable.

This state sees a company as ready for acquisition or ready for IPO.

Both the Venture Capital and the Growth Equity stage exist to leave equity for the company for future growth rounds. Consequently, less than 50% of the company stakes are taken. This is defined as minority stakes.

Beyond this, Private Equity firms may sweep in and take 100% of the stakes in the company. The company is then scaled up for 4-7 years and consequently sold for a few million to billions to a strategic buyer. To qualify for Private Equity, a company needs great free cash flow, because Private Equity firms use about 

_Isn't it very risky for a Venture Capital firm to invest?_

It is. Due to the high risk, Venture Capitalist seek higher return to the later, more secure Growth Equity stage. A Venture Capital firm expects only 1-2 companies in their portfolio to succeed (succeeding meaning a 8-19 time return on their investment) and have a few solid companies in the mix (one time return in their investment).

_I'm already a functioning company, what comes next?_

Growth Equity is possibly what is necessary. To qualify for growth equity and its result - which is to say acquisition or going public, a company should have at least a revenue of $5 million, 20% revenue growth in the last few years and a proven business model. If qualified, the amounts one can expect range from $10 million to more than $500 million.
