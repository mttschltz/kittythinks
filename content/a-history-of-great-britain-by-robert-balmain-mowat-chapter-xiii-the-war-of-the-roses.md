# CHAPTER XIII - The War of the Roses

_The Lead-Up_

The Hundred Years' War has drained Britain's morale. Military forces have become disillusioned. Many nobles have put returning men-at-arms in livery, i.e. on payroll, like household servants. To identify a solider as belonging to a lord, a badge is sewn unto his cloak. 

In 1430, a law is passed preventing those from voting in elections, who are not freeholders with land valued at least 40 shillings a year. The House of Lords has become smaller, more insular and without any representatives for the villeins. Those ~ 50 baronial families left in the House, are engaged in many small rivalries with each other.

Besides the moral and legal deterioration, the Lancastrian government is also financially on a downward trajectory; by 1433, treasurer Lord Cromwell records expenditures of £50.000, but a revenue of only £38.000.

Henry VI. is a religious and old-fashioned king. He marries Margaret of Anjou in 1445. His government is weak.

Voices grow louder each day about mismanagement. The country needs a new leader and the people want the Duke of York for the job. Queen Margaret favours the Duke of Somerset as Henry's council. Henry goes against the people and elects Somerset.
