Two things I find interesting: How businesses succeed and how other people make money.\
This book concerns angel investing, the early stage of raising cash for startups.

In the fashion of previous business book summaries, I will keep this to the point, for easy perusing.

_Founding Rounds for Businesses (rarely all observed):_

* _Sweat Equity_ = founders work or free
* _Bootstrapping_ = money found outside o investors (e.g. clients willing to finance product)
* _Friends & Family_
* _Self-funding_
* _Incubator Funding =_ 5-10% seed funding (25k-150k)
* **_Seed/Angel Funding_ = usually after 2/3 rounds above**
* _Bridge Round/Seed Plus_ = angel money runs out before the company qualifies for Series A
* _Series A_ = usually done by professional venture capital firm
* _Series B-F & Mezzanine Rounds_ = usually far removed from angel investing

_For Whom Angel Investing Is:_

Angel investing is done for businesses **less than three years** old, with **no traction**, which are **looking for product or market fit**.

If a business has achieved monetization, it is either bought by a bigger company or it goes public. Both of these outcomes, which are giving investors a return on their money, are known as **exit**.

Other potential outcomes are so called **acquihires**, in which a company is acquired specifically to hire it's talent, and **unicorn** companies which manage to get a value of 1 billion USD.

_Angel Skills:_

1. _Money_(have it)
2. _Time_(give it)
3. _Network_(connect them)
4. _Expertise_ (teach them)
5. _People Skills_(read them)

_Angel How-To's:_

Pro rata means continued investing in subsequent round so one may maintain one's original percentage in a company. It is advised to insist on** pro rata rights** in contracts with companies.

Relocate to Silicon Valley or Sweden.

Your time is valuable.

**Angel Syndicates** are groups of investors willing to pool together under a leader, to invest together. They is a **carry**, or carried interest, and it is the share of profits that go to the syndicate lead.

New Angels should do **10 small syndicate investments** first before direct investing. This may get you a return, or if nothing else, a reputation.

On **how to choose an investment** while using a syndicate: 

1. Lead has at least 5 years investing experience and one unicorn investment.
2. Situated in Silicon Valley.
3. At least 2 founders.
4. Product or service is already in the market.
5. Either 6 months of continuous user growth or 6 months of revenue.
6. Notable Investors.
7. Post-funding, 18 months runway.

On building '**social currency**' with other angels:

* Create spreadsheet of all co-investors in ten startups invested in (~600 investors)
* Add LinkedIn, Syndicate, Twitter & Facebook URLs
* Connect with each on all platforms
* Make Twitter list titled "co_investors" and add all investors, fav, retweet & reply to fellow investors' tweets 1-2 times daily

**Don't fall for artificial deadlines and scarcity.**

How to **meet a founder**:

* 1h minimum + 30 minutes
* Full attention
* "Let me turn off my phone"
* Pen & paper
* Conference room > Coffee Shop
* Asking for more detail shows beforehand shows that you are focused on things that matter
* Never say Yes or No during a pitch
* Go for big ideas & strong founders
* Businesses made from bits > businesses made from atoms
* It is easier to know what won't work

How to **judge a founder**:

* Question why a founder doesn't want to do certain jobs
* Question why they think they will have "balance" in their life

Write **deal memos**.

Insist on **monthly updates**.

Bad founders are revealed in **year 2**.

"**Feature Death March**" - the belief that just adding two or three more features will surely help to make a company big.

If **the press** calls, tell the founder and avoid answering the journalist.

Some angels **bet on founders**, some **on problems**, some **on delight** and some **on markets**. Decide.

**SUPER SUMMARY**

1. Only Silicon Valley
2. Always Meet
3. Due Diligence
4. Write on Paper
5. Demand monthly updates

**Useful Quotes**:

> _"When you first start investing, you should meet with as many people as possible but invest in as few deals as possible."_
>
> _"Your challenge isn't writing checks, it's convincing the right founders to cash them."_
>
> _"Avoid the liars. Embrace the delusional."_
