_I found** A History of Great Britain (B.C. 55 - A.D. 1603)** in a small book exchange, in a rather tattered state. My copy is from 1929 (the book was first printed in 1920) and is Part I in a series of, perhaps, three books (Mowat died in 1941, the books end in 1918). A retelling of a history book might seem a bit strange, but isn't it always exciting to see someone talk about the past who is now himself an artifact of history?_

# CHAPTER I - Ancient Britain

Mowat starts out with taking us on a walk through Ancient Britain.\
\
First, he describes the two types of people that inhabited Britain: The small, dark haired Iberians, which with their darker complexion were the more ancient people of the region and can still be found, unchanged, in the Basque region of Europe, and the tall, fair haired Celts, with their white and reddish skins, from Central Asia.

While the former thrived in cities due to their resistance to stress, the latter needed the calm of the countryside to prosper.

Ancient British villages were comprised of huts made of wood, with thatched roofs and surrounded by palisades or prickly hedges. These villages were situated by forests or on islands. Each tribe was governed by a chief.

The people lived by hunting, keeping sheep and growing some (weak) wheat.
