# The Purpose of the Court of Law

![](/images/uploads/justitia_smaller.png)

## The role of courts and law is **not to punish**. It is **not to impose moral judgement** and it is **not to teach lessons**. _The role of the judiciary is to protect society from objective, tangible harm._

Court sentences have long been used as a tool to impose current virtues, such as in the case of prosecution of prostitution, gambling or drug offences. 

Offences against societal norms, such as noise complaints, desecration of memorials and other sacred places, bigamy and public indecency, are also examples of _**virtue-judgements**, rather than sentences concerning true crimes_.

These transgressions should not be ignored, but rather they should not be treated as _crimes worthy of judgement in court_. They are, in effect, misdeeds unbecoming the current societal climate and should be corrected by independent entities with proportional comeuppance.

I suggest that a drug dealer, prostitute or gambler may be best corrected by **providing meaningful educational or vocational means** to alleviate their likely financial hardships.

Those who lack appreciation for sacred places or the protection of virtues should **benefit from a re-schooling** on the matters, perhaps **through charitable services** rendered.

A further practice commonly seen is a judge making an example of someone to deter future criminals. However, _theatrics must not have a place in courts_.

This is not the job of a judge. Even when ignoring that deterrence by harsher punishment appears to have little effect¹, it is further _evidence of “vengeance”_, which I argue is an _**emotional response** to perceived wrongdoing and **not prevention** of objective, tangible harm to society_.

Because of this idea – that vengeance is not the job of the court – multiple life sentences, death penalties and theatrical sentences (“30 nights in doghouse”²) should not be handed out.

I have so far argued that sentences are only legitimate if they are objective and tangible. It is necessary to explain that this idea is based on the notion that **certain crimes** and their punishment, such as murder or rape, are _not merely moral judgements of our time_, but rather **natural laws**. The Natural Law Theory, or Ius naturale positions that some laws are natural, rather than made - this is the position I defend. Natural Law has long been criticised for its connection to religion and antiquity, and its tension with ius positum, or human-made law. It is in ongoing conflict with issues of international law, such as human rights violations.

The application of natural law is here limited to that what is already applied. 

We are _already agreeing_ that **humans have intrinsic rights**³. It is only logical to thus recognise that _certain acts_ that are _universally understood to be against human nature_ and have never been ‘made’ but are rather innate to all our instincts, **must be the sole focus of the judiciary**.

It is those crimes that are naturally understood by all, beyond languages and conventions, to be harmful and unjust, that the court of law is to protect society from.
