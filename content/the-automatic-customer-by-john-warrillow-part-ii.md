We've learned _why_ the subscription model is better, but what are the different subscription models (well, nine of them)?

# The Automatic Customer

**The Membership Website Model**

_What_: Publish your content behind a paywall that requires members to buy access.

_For Whom_:  Those with highly specialized information that keeps changing over time. Niche market.

_How_: Multiple formats.

_Best Customer_: Business-to-business companies.

_Extra_: Hard to only live of subscriber monetization. Additional services, e.g. conferences, coaching, courses, ma be necessary. 

**The All-You-Can-Eat Library Model**

_What_: Unlimited access to large amount of knowledge that the consumer can rent. Not designed for the possibility to consume all its value.

_For Whom_: Those with access to, or the ability to acquire, a library of content (e.g. Netflix). Existing fans.

_How_: Offer an ultimatum - subscribe to the whole library or get nothing.

_Best Customer_: Everyone.

_Extra_: Requires a lot of money upfront!
