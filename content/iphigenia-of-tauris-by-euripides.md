The goddess has saved her with deception and she has been send to Tauris, ruled by Thoas, to serve there as priestess of Artemis' temple. By Taurian custom, any foreigner who dares to step foot on its coast will be sacrificed to the goddess of the hunt.

Iphigenia has a dream concerning the death of her brother, Orestes. 

Meanwhile, Orestes and his cousin and best friend Pylades have been exiled from Athens and send on a mission to redeem themselves: they must find the statue of Artemis and bring it back home.\
They arrive on the coast of Tauris and decide to hide in a cave, until the night, to find a way into the temple.
