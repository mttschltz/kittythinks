## Cabbages 

![](/images/uploads/cabbage_vegetables_food_healthy-1-.jpg)

_**Pliny's health advice:**_

+ **headaches**, **impaired vision**, **spots** before the eyes, **spleen** & stomach, **hypochondria** are cured by a mix of cabbage with oxymel (a mixture of raw honey, vinegar, and herbs), coriander, rue, mint, and silphium root (silphium is a now-extinct plant, likely from the Ferula family - it can be substituted with asafoetida) taken in the morning

+ fresh and old **wounds** and **malignant lesions** that cannot be healed with any other means, should be covered by pounded cabbage, stirred in hot water twice a day

+ **fistulas, tumors**, and **sprains** are to be treated the same way

+ **preventing dreams and insomnia** (when eaten with oil while otherwise fasting)

+ **improves eyesight** (when cabbage juice is mixed with Attic honey)

+ **paralysis**

+ **coughing up blood**

\
_**Pliny's entertaining anecdotes:**_

_The mixture to be taken in the morning for all sorts of ailments is said to make the person who makes it stronger (!)_ \[Cato]

_Due to cabbage being a bad companion to vines, cabbage prevents the wine drinker from getting drunk when they eat cabbage before consumption or neutralizes the intoxication if cabbage is eaten afterward (!)_ \[Greek common knowledge]
