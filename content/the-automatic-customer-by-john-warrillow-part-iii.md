The why and the what is covered - onto the how.

# The Automatic Customer

> _"The moment you switch to a subscription model your P&L will start to look ugly."_

P&L = Profit and Loss. The amount of money one makes after one pays expenses and the cost to make what is being sold. In subscription businesses, one's renting access to a product or service over time.

> _"The foundation of your subscription business is built on your monthly recurring revenue (MRR)."_

Membership Price / 12 = MRR rate

> _"The next number you need to understand is the lifetime value (LTV) of a subscriber."_

Number of months customer stays on x MRR = LTV

> _"The next data point you need to assess the health of your subscription business is your customer acquisition cost (CAC)."_

Cost of sales and marketing / Number of subscribers acquired = CAC

Warrillow points out that the earliest subscribers are likely "love and guilt" ones - family and friends. Those need to be discounted to get a true CAC.

On sales channels, Warrillow explains varying options. The most interesting one (to me) is _Self-Serve_. With the example of Ancestry.com, self-serve is a sale strategy which uses no outbound salespeople, but instead  relies on marketing copy and videos to explain their offering.

> _"\[...] the CAC payback period measures how many months it takes you to make back the cost of acquiring a customer."_

 Total Sales and Marketing Costs for a Month / New MRR added for the Month = Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) Payback Period

This is used by venture capital forms to whet investment opportunities.

Next up, a short lesson on cash to grow. Warrillow shows three methods:

1. Nonrecurring sources - taking profits from a traditional business reinvested into a subscription business.
2. Outside money - if one's LTV:CAC ratio is north of 3:1 at scale +large market, likely that investors are willing to give.
3. Charge upfront - get paid before delivering the good/service (e.g. by charging per year instead of per month).

> _"Increasingly, our bar for opting into a subscription relationship is getting higher."_

Customer are starting to experience fatigue. They realized that they're likely to forget to unsubscribe to recurring subscriptions. Warrillow shows 7 way to stave off the fatigue:

1. 10 x vs. 10% - _"A customer with an acute case of subscriotion fatigue is unlikely to subscribe just to save 10%, but she might be convinced to subscribe if you could make a case that she will enjoy 10 times the value of the alternative."_
2. Appeal to Rationality - Essential when selling to other businesses.
3. The Ultimatum - the service is only available as a subscription. Especially useful for existing one-shot customers from traditional businesses.
4. Freemium - a free taste of what's to come (continuously available).
5. The Trial - Like a freemium, but with a start and end date.
6. The Gift - bank on customers' need to be nice to others.
7.  Fire! - To prevent subscription stagnation, create artificial FOMO (e.g. through _"If you subscribe until X time, you will get your subscription for Y price! Limited time only!"_)
