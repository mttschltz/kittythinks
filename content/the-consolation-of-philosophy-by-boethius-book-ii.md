## The Consolation of Philosophy - Book II

Boethius grieves because he has lost his good fortunes. Philosophy is sure he knew that Fortune always toys with those who least expect it.

If Boethius knows this, then why did he ever think anything from Fortune's hand was worth having? He has thus lost nothing. In fact, Philosophy adds, when Boethius was in good times, he often spoke of Fortune's treacheries.

Lady Philosophy analyzes further: Boethius might think he been forsaken by Fortune, but she, Fortune, has not change at all, she is in fact constant in her inconsistencies.

Does he not know the Wheel of Fortune? Either one embraces Fortune without complaint, or fully reject her. 

Is it Fortune's fault then that Boethius is unhappy? Philosophy does not think so. 

When born, she explains, humans are naked, poor and helpless. It is Fortune who pampers them, gives them luxuries. Boethius was in fact showered with them. Humans become angry when Fortune takes these fortunes away because they falsely feel they owned all these things she has given. However, they never owned a thing, they should thank her for the loan she gave them.

If the things Boethius complains have been taken from him were actually his, they would still be there.

Why does Boethius lament that his fortunes have changed but not the lost fortunes of others? Is he so ignorant as to assume the laws of fortune don't apply to him? Wheels are round and spinning them, makes them fall how they may.

Philosophy goes on to explain that things couldn't be different anyway. If every prayer led to blessings, humans would simply take them for granted.
