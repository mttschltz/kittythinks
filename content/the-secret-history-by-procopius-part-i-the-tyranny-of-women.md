**Story**

General Belisarius is married to a magic worker - Antonia. Like all magic-workers, her primary aim is to bewitch her husband and be morally loose. Thus is the opinion of Procopius.

Antonia's impropriety is showcased by her relationship with Theodosius, a boy that Belisarius had adopted. The two get caught in flagranti on multi occasions, but Antonia always convinces her husband that he must be mistaken

Belisarius' bewitchment and Antonia's magic is further shown when Belisarius, once a famed General in Emperor Justinian's army, is failing emperor and country after he lets an enemy infiltrate and attack Rome. Belisarius had been so worried that his wife might be home alone for too long, that he let all this happen.

Next, Procopius tells us of Empress Theodora. She is cruel and immoral - not respecting the sanctaty of churches and imprisioning people for little reason. \
Theodora eventually rids Belisarius of his rank as a General and scatters his men-at-arms to effectively disable his power. In Roman law, this made him a private citizen.
