It's November 2024, 1009 days ago, Russia invaded Ukraine. \
Despite life going on largely unchanged in the rest of the world, Europe has effectively been at war for almost 3 years.

Recently, the countries more concerned (either through proximity or history) have been putting out leaflets and advice to both private and corporate citizens of their country, to prepare them for a potential new war on the continent.

Here, I will review some of the new war preparedness advice that has been published.

# Germany

It should not come as a surprise that Germany, a country that is experienced in wars and its hardships, is particularly on alert.

The Bundeswehr, the German army, is going to publish a hundreds-of-pages strong document labelled "OPLAN DEU" - Operation Plan Germany. Thus far, it is top-secret, but it will contain a complete outline of all levels of German society and how they will have to react and interact in case the eastern flank of Europe requires defending. This will include making Germany a hub for NATO allies, to cover logistics. 

This interesting approach does have some philosophical concerns. Germany already has far-reaching powers over its own people in crisis situations, in the case of an out-right war (which is interesting to consider in the modern age - is it a war if espionage is obvious even to the average person? Or is war only 'the bomb dropped'?), it could revert to a planned economy.

The government could compel people to work in certain jobs, ration food and other supplies and make companies aid in the war effort. The obvious ethical concerns are compounded by anyone to agrees to this, also creating a new target on their backs.\
A company interested in supporting this preparedness plan is opening itself up for espionage.

In real life, the Bundeswehr has encouraged voluntary reserve soldiers to practice for potential invasion in a fictional scenario in Hamburg. Here, in September 2024, the volunteers were imagining an attack by water on the critical port structure. The operation _Red Storm Alpha _will be followed up by a larger scale one called _Red Storm Bravo_.

Now to consider what the German government recommends in terms of emergency supplies, and what the country believes to have, the information appears as follows:

The food groups most vulnerable are vegetables and fruit, plant-based oils and fats and protein-rich feed for animals. 

Germany has secret bunkers with emergency staples. Grains are stored all over the country. Wheat, rye and oats are available. Rice, legumes and condensed milk are also stored and meant to provide Germans (especially those in cities) with one secure meal a day. The amount is estimated to be 9,7 kg per citizen.\
These reserves will not have to feed soldiers, as the Bundeswehr has its own storage of food to guarantee the stability of the fighting force.

This governmental help would only last for a very short time, however, and the rest would need to be made up by people's own initiative. The government recommends a minimum private reserve for three days. It stresses especially the storage of liquid. 1.5l for an adult, per day,plus 500ml of water for cooking. Other drinks can also be considered.

How much food can either be eyeballed or - in typical German fashion! - precisely calculated. The government offers a handy calculator for emergency storage that can help for 1 to 28 days: <https://www.ernaehrungsvorsorge.de/private-vorsorge/notvorrat/vorratskalkulator>

This calculator is _very_ generous with its amounts (e.g. 1.98kg of grain products to be consumed by two adults over 3 days, is A LOT - the assumption being 2200 kcals per person), but it gives excellent ideas on **what** to purchase.

For example, it suggests tinned beans, carrots, mushrooms, corn, sauerkraut, red cabbage and gherkins, but also fresh onions. It suggests buying fresh fruit such as apples, pears, bananas and oranges, in addition to tinned fruit like cherries, apricots, peaches and pineapples, plus dried plums, raisins and hazelnuts. It suggests hard cheese and long-life milk, salami, tinned sardines, herring and tuna, leberwurst (tinned) and eggs.

Additional products recommended are sugar, salt, honey, jam, chocolate, ready-meals such as soups, tinned pasta and mashed potatoes, flour, cocoa, instant broth, hard biscuits and pretzel sticks.

It is noted in the calculator that these recommendations were a combined effort of German, Austrian and Swiss informations.

# Sweden

With its proximity to Russia, Sweden, like its neighbour Finland, has reasons to be concerned. They have both applied to join NATO and the Nordic country has distributed a 32-page document to its citizens on what to do when war comes. Ominously, the brochure starts out with this:

> To resist these threats, we must stand united.
>
> If Sweden is attacked, everyone must do their
>
> part to defend Sweden’s independence – and
>
> our democracy.
>
> _If Sweden is attacked, we will never surrender._
>
> _Any suggestion to the contrary is false._

The brochure tells the Swede that they must be able to manage on their own for at least a week. A list of home preparedness suggests what one should have at home:

Water in lidded containers or bottles, 3 litres per day (this includes cooking water). Warm clothing and alternative fuel sources, communication devices (radio, power bank for a phone, phone numbers written down on paper), non-perishable food (grains, ready-meals, tinned fruit & vegetables, tinned legumes, tinned meat & fish, tubed cheese, honey, jam, chocolate, baby & infant food and most interestingly: blueberry and rosehip soup!).

Another interesting advice is to** have cash of various denominations at hand**. This isn't a common piece of advice and I think is worth highlighting for anyone!

It makes sure to explain that in a heightened state of alert, all Swedes aged 16 to 70 may be called to serve in some capacity. Interestingly, this includes foreign nationals that reside in Sweden AND Swedes abroad! 

In case of attack, sirens with a specific sound pattern are activated. They require citizens to go indoors, close windows and doors and turn off ventilation systems. Then they are to find a radio or TV to get instructions. Which type of siren sounds, indicates the threat level. Public Service announcements may just be about a certain area, while Emergency Alarms indicate a threat to the entire country. The latter requires all armed forces personnel to go to their wartime posting. The Air Raid sirens indicate the need for cover in civil defense shelters or cellars.

The list of possible shelters and what to do when one can't reach a shelter are extensive and provided with illustrations (page 13). Sweden has really thought this through.

It has some 64000 shelters for 7 million people. They are indicated with this sign:

# Norway & Finland

As with Sweden, Norway and Finland are in the direct firing line of Russia. Consequently, they both released information to the public about what to do in case of war impacts their countries. 

A lot of the information is similar to Sweden. One difference is the recommendation for a DAB radio in case of communication outages. DAB is a system that replaces analoguous radio transmission with digital. Problematically, while Norway has officially switched the entire country to DAB in 2017, Finland has instead abandoned its rollout in 2005, and has focussed on digitising 5G broadcasting (while all major radio is also available in FM).
