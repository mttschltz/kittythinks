Prior to 1363, China was a Mongolian vassal. This changed with one man:  Zhu Yuanzhang (1328-1398). Zhu was a poor novice monk who had been orphaned early on. He had seen the devastation that foreign rule could cause (namely famines and uprisings) and decided to join a rebel group to initiate change.

Within five years, the Mongol rule was over.

Zhu's ambition was the restructuring of China, and he started with revitalising the agricultural landscape. Countless trees were planted (estimations say 1 billion mulberry trees, orchards and trees for shipbuilding in just 20 years), arable land cultivated and supllied with water and the income from grain tripled.

The emperor, who would choose the name Hóngwǔ ("vastly martial"), could not forget his disdain for those who did not fight against the Mongols, so he created a regime that was absolutist. Personnel were executed on mere suspicion of disloyalty, and all ministries were to report directly to and through him.
