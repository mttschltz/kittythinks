# CHAPTER VIII - Guinne, Wales, Scotland

Besides Ireland, the french town of Guinne, Wales and Scotland were without proper English rule.

**Guinne** was disputed territory with France and war seems inevitable.

Soon, Henry III. tries to take Poitou and fails miserably. He decides to sign the 'Treaty of Paris'* in 1259, with the french king Louis IX. 

_\*Not to be confused with the 32 other events named 'Treaty of Paris'._

The 1259 treaty leaves France with all important parts of the country and Guinne as a fief to the French Crown. Henry is now effectively a vassal to Louis IX.

This odd arrangement and the lack of exact borders, means continuous war between the two powers.

**Wales** has so far remained largely tribal, governed by an array of princes. After his father's death in 1272 and his crowing in the same year, Edward I., decides in 1277 to attack Wales and it's current 'Prince of Wales', Llewellyn.

Edward is victorious. Cardigan and Carmarthen are given to England and Llewelyn is demoted to Lord of Snowdon.

In 1282, Llewelyn's brother starts to revolt and LLywelyn feels compelled to join him. The Welsh are ill-prepared and after a sneak attack, Llewelyn is surrounded and struck down. He would become the last sovereign Prince of Wales.

In 1284, Parliament decrees that all of Wales must be annexed to the English Crown.

**Scotland **had his own king, Alexander III., until his accidental death in 1286.
