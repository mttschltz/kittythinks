## MODERN MONOPOLIES by Ale Moazed & Nicholas L. Johnson – _concerns platform businesses_

![null](/images/uploads/monopolies.jpg)

While the internet is open, every activity has to go through a **platform**.

The old business model – Product/Service = Distribution = Customer

The new platform business model – _consumer and producer are the same and work through a platform_.

Platforms create the means of connection.

Core transactions of a platform:

(1) **Audience building**

(2) **Matchmaking**

(3) Providing **core tool and services**

(4) Setting **rules and standards**

_Capitalism and competition are opposites._

What provides defensibility against copycats? _Networks of users, transactions or data_.

_Unicorn Company_ – a company valued at more than US$1 billion.

Platforms become more efficient the larger they become.\
Expenses don’t grow as fast as revenue does at this point.

_Short-term goals_: user acquisition and expansion.\
_Long-term goals_: user retention and diminishing funds

_Network value_ – is value users derive from other people’s use of a platform.

Revenue avenues have to be adapted to **what devices users use most**.

_Core transaction_ – platforms need their users to repeat core transactions over and over. 

Core transaction for _Exchange Platforms_ (e.g. etsy, ebay) – use a double opt-in: both parties have to agree to exchange at **that** moment.

Focusing on ONE core transaction first, makes success more likely.

There is currently no good troll and harassment tool available.

Create a _lightweight platform as quickly as possible_ to gather feedback and see if the idea works. **Modify later**.

Sustainable networks > vanity metrics (e.g. amount of users)

Potential new users are driven by an attraction to an existing user base.

Attract marquee users in the beginning to uphold a certain quality.

_If one’s platform business ISN’T under scrutiny by law – maybe it isn’t big enough of an idea._

Could your business **sell virtual goods?**

Remove transaction costs – money, time OR effort.

Use under-served markets.

Large supply, that isn’t connected, is important.

## ZERO TO ONE by Peter Thiel – _concerns start-up building_

![null](/images/uploads/zerotoone.jpg)

**QUICK NOTE: I had a few serious issues with this book. I decided to include them in my notes. Those critical notes are in bold and italic and contain two pluses. This does _not_ take away from the useful parts.**

_“What important truth do very few people agree with you on?”_

Dot-com bubble while crazy, had an upside – it showed optimism about a technological future.

To make money – _Monopoly > Perfect Competition_. Monopolies own their market, while competitors have to price-gauge through the market.

_“In business, equilibrium means stasis, and stasis means death.”_ - If one’s in competition, one’s demise won’t be felt. One needs to be **indispensable**.

The more one competes, the less on gains. _War is costly business._

Proprietary technology must be at least 10 x better than the closest competitor. How? By making something completely new.

Every start-up should _start with a very small market_. After = monopolize.

Sequencing is underrated. Dominate a _specific niche first_ and then scale to adjacent markets.

Well-roundedness = many-sided mediocrity. _“Be a monopoly of your own.”_

_++ **Peter Thiel is calling out Europe for having a “vacation-mania” - fundamentally misunderstanding Europeans…**++_

How can the future get better if no one plans for it? \
**In start-ups**: _Intelligent Design > Darwinism_

Founders only sell when they have no concrete vision for the company anymore. 

++ _**Largely unconnected philosophy undergrad ramble about the evils of not believing in “secrets”.**++_

A start-up which messes up its foundation, cannot be fixed.

Unless a company is publicly held, its _board should never exceed 5 people_ and is ideally comprised of 3 people.

++ _**Thiel decries employees who ask for an actual salary instead of  those taking equity as payment...**++_

Attract good employees by explaining why your mission is compelling.

Distribution is essential to the design of a product – start-ups should not attempt to compete (in design) with big companies.

_Clean up your digital footprint!_

Computers won’t replace humans, but complement them. ++ _**(Thiel forgets jobs that are not IT; those will unquestionably be replaced, and so will all simple IT jobs, e.g. data entry, admin etc.)**++_

(1) The Engineering Question: **Can you create a breakthrough?**

(2) The Timing Question: **Is this the right time?**

(3) The Monopoly Question: **Are you starting with a big share?**

(4) The People Question: **Are you starting with the right team?**

(5) The Distribution Question: **Do you know how to sell?**

(6) The Disability Question: **Is your idea still feasible in 10 to 20 years?**

(7) The Secret Question:** Is your idea unique?**

_“Real technologists wear T-shirts and jeans”_ ++ _**(ok?...Thiel should read up on gatekeeping.)**++_

Highly visible success can attract highly visible attacks.

## BLUE OCEAN STRATEGY by W. Chan Kim & Renée Mauborgne – _concerns market space_

![null](/images/uploads/blueoceanstrategy.jpg)

Reduce (confusion), Eliminate (varying interfaces), Create (ease-of-use interface), Raise (price)

**Red Ocean** = market with lots of competition, **Blue Ocean** = new market.

## RUNNING LEAN by Ash Maurya – _concerns minimalist business planning_

_“Customers don’t care about your solution. They care about their problems.”_ by Dave McClure, 500 Startups

How to get the product right:

(1) Have a **problem worth solving.**

(2) Define **smallest possible solution**.

(3) **Build** (small).

(4) **Verify** at a large scale.

How to get customers:

(1) **Who** has the ‘pain’.

(2) Find **early adopters**.

(3) **Outbound channels are ok**.

(4) Build **scalable inbound channels asap**.

Building a viable business:

(1) **Identify your competition** and set a price.

(2) See **what customers think** **of** your **pricing** (verbally).

(3) Test **what customers actually do with** your **pricing**.

(4) **Optimize** pricing.

_“Content precedes design. Design in the absence of content is not design, it’s decoration.”_ by Jeffrey Zeldman, A List Apart

_Multi-sided Product_ – connects buyers and sellers and provides value by reducing transaction friction.

Build _only necessary features _first. **Short coding sessions only.**

_80%_ should be _spend optimizing necessary features._

If one’s company has _both customers and users, two Lean Canvases_ are necessary.

**Charge from day 1.**
