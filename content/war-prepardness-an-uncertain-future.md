It's November 2024, 1009 days ago, Russia invaded Ukraine. \
Despite life going on largely unchanged in the rest of the world, Europe has effectively been at war for almost 3 years.

Recently, the countries more concerned (either through proximity or history) have been putting out leaflets and advice to both private and corporate citizens of their country, to prepare them for a potential new war on the continent.

Here, I will review some of the new war preparedness advice that has been published.

# Germany

It should not come as a surprise that Germany, a country that is experienced in wars and its hardships, is particularly on alert.

The Bundeswehr, the German army, is going to publish a hundreds-of-pages strong document labelled "OPLAN DEU" - Operation Plan Germany. Thus far, it is top-secret, but it will contain a complete outline of all levels of German society and how they will have to react and interact in case the eastern flank of Europe requires defending. This will include making Germany a hub for NATO allies, to cover logistics. 

This interesting approach does have some philosophical concerns. Germany already has far-reaching powers over its own people in crisis situations, in the case of an out-right war (which is interesting to consider in the modern age - is it a war if espionage is obvious even to the average person? Or is war only 'the bomb dropped'?), it could revert to a planned economy.

The government could compel people to work in certain jobs, ration food and other supplies and make companies aid in the war effort. The obvious ethical concerns are compounded by anyone to agrees to this, also creating a new target on their backs.\
A company interested in supporting this preparedness plan is opening itself up for espionage.

In real life, the Bundeswehr has encouraged voluntary reserve soldiers to practice for potential invasion in a fictional scenario in Hamburg. Here, in September 2024, the volunteers were imagining an attack by water on the critical port structure. The operation _Red Storm Alpha _will be followed up by a larger scale one called _Red Storm Bravo_.

Now to consider what the German government recommends in terms of emergency supplies, and what the country believes to have, the information appears as follows:

The food groups most vulnerable are vegetables and fruit, plant-based oils and fats and protein-rich feed for animals. 

Germany has secret bunkers with emergency staples. Grains are stored all over the country. Wheat, rye and oats are available. Rice, legumes and condensed milk are also stored and meant to provide Germans (especially those in cities) with one secure meal a day. The amount is estimated to be 9,7 kg per citizen.\
These reserves will not have to feed soldiers, as the Bundeswehr has its own storage of food to guarantee the stability of the fighting force.

This governmental help would only last for a very short time, however, and the rest would need to be made up by people's own initiative. The government recommends a minimum private reserve for three days. It stresses especially the storage of liquid. 1.5l for an adult, per day,plus 500ml of water for cooking. Other drinks can also be considered.

How much food can either be eyeballed or - in typical German fashion! - precisely calculated. The government offers a handy calculator for emergency storage that can help for 1 to 28 days: <https://www.ernaehrungsvorsorge.de/private-vorsorge/notvorrat/vorratskalkulator>

This calculator is _very_ generous with its amounts (e.g. 1.98kg of grain products to be consumed by two adults over 3 days, is A LOT - the assumption being 2200 kcals per person), but it gives excellent ideas on **what** to purchase.

For example, it suggests tinned beans, carrots, mushrooms, corn, sauerkraut, red cabbage and gherkins, but also fresh onions. It suggests buying fresh fruit such as apples, pears, bananas and oranges, in addition to tinned fruit like cherries, apricots, peaches and pineapples, plus dried plums, raisins and hazelnuts. It suggests hard cheese and long-life milk, salami, tinned sardines, herring and tuna, leberwurst (tinned) and eggs.

Additional products recommended are sugar, salt, honey, jam, chocolate, ready-meals such as soups, tinned pasta and mashed potatoes, flour, cocoa, instant broth, hard biscuits and pretzel sticks.

It is noted in the calculator that these recommendations were a combined effort of German, Austrian and Swiss informations.
