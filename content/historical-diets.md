Diets have and still differ between eras and countries. It isn't always easy to imagine how our ancestors managed - but did they eat better than us? Let's find out!

## Paleolithic

## China



## Aztecs & Mayans

## Egyptians & Mesopotamians

## Romans & Greeks

Was it all wine, oil and bread? The answer is maybe!\
\
The Graeco-Roman period, a time between 8th century BCE to the 5th century CE, was marked by great deeds and interesting people, but it was also a period of culinary curiosity, which was the very foundation of the now-lauded Mediterranean diet. 

I do dare to lump the Greeks and the Romans together, but of course, it must be understood that there were differences. Whatever such differences may be, it is easy to find commonalities in literature of the time. Both nations loved to write about food and customs surrounding it, therefore, let's begin!

As in every age, Graeco-Romans were divided by class, region and custom.

 It was especially important for these Ancients to eat the _right_ things at the _proper_ time. \
The elite was besotted with roasted meat, especially beef. This had mythical connection: it had been believed that the first humans, those still divine, were solely sustaining themselves from what the Earth had given them, but when humans invented boundaries and attempted to tame the soil beneath, they invited misery to their doors. Thus, the gods had to intervene. 

Cattle were brought to the Romans via Hercule in one of his labours. Consequently, it was considered a gift from the gods. Similar stories can be found for grain and wine.

So this is the basis of the Ancient Mediterranean diet: Grain (and additionally legumes, which can be grown in the same field in succession), grapes (especially in the form of wine) and olives (especially as oil). In addition, those who could afford it, supplemented their tables with meat, fish, vegetables and fruit.

How much of each category were consumed, depended on both location and occupation. 

Grain grew well in the Mediterranean climate, you could expect wheat, barley, millet, rye, spelt, emmer and oats. Greek physician Galen ranked barley and wheat as the most nutritious.

Grain was primarily made into bread and cakes. This laborious process fell to slaves and women. The basis of nutrition was relegated to the lowest-ranking people in society, a theme that is common in the Ancient world. Status was everything.

Wheat, depending on its quality, could either make raised loaves or flat cakes. Barley was used in biscuits and as gruel.

Rural Ancients ate wheat as a porridge, either mixed with milk or water, and if possible with the addition of honey and wine.

The other grains, such as barley, emmer and spelt, were used for different purposes in the two countries. Barley grew better in Greece than Italy, so barley features more prominently there. At the Romans, it was used more commonly for ritual practises, such as a sacrifice in the form of a salted cake. It was also used as punishment for soldiers - if they stepped out of line, their rations were changed from wheat to barley.

The Greeks in particular made a simple porridge from barley that most anyone could afford. When barley was roasted (which must have been common as a law from the 6th century BCE required Athenian brides to bring a _phrygetron,_ a barley roaster into the marriage), it was ground into flour and mixed with milk or oil to make _maza_, an uncooked cake.

The traditional grain for the Romans was emmer (hulled wheat) and spelt.

Like the Greek's barley, emmer made a simple porridge, called _puls_, which was evidently popular. 

Wealthy Romans had personal orchards, vinyards and gardens, while the rest purchased there fruit and vegetables from market gardens. 

Common vegetables included cabbages, leeks, lettuces, radishes, endives, turnips and broccoli. Lentils, broad bean and peas made up the legume assortment. Figs, dates, plums, melons and peaches complimented the ever present grapes (which were made into wine and vinegar, and eaten as raisins and in their natural form).

So a menu in a well-off Roman and to a degree Ancient Greek household would look something like this:

1st course: salad, eggs in some form and shellfish\
2nd course: roasted meat and fish\
3rd course: fruit and nuts

All of course, with wine and the famous _garum_, a fermented fish sauce.

As sugar was not yet present, sweet dishes contained natural sugar from fruit and honey, or cooked-down sugar from grapes (grape must). The two latter ones - honey and must, could also be combined and cooked down into a thick syrup called _passum. _

All in all, the Roman and Greek diet was balanced and quite healthy, albeit overly heavy in strong flavours (fermented fish entrails and vinegars would not suit everyone's taste today). It is no wonder that the "Mediterranean Diet" of the present resembles the Ancient diet so much!

## Middle Ages

The Middle Ages technically comprise three eras. While the early Middle Ages were still reminiscent of the Pagan age that preceded it, and the attitudes towards communal eating, the High Middle Ages were strictly separated affairs. During the late medieval period, the norms changed again. 

Those of high rank (nobles and the clergy) had different allowances and habits than the workers. It was believed that this separation was natural to the point, that the higher-ranking members of society had a naturally more sensitive disposition. \
Coarse bread and simple pottage were fare not tolerated by the upper crust.

I will focus on the High Middle Ages (AD 1000 to 1300) and central and western Europe.

To start of, the medieval era tended to eat two meals and no snacks. IF breakfast was eaten (by the rich who had the time or the better-off when planning a very long horse ride), it was bread and cheese. 

The more common first meal was dinner. This was consumed at around 10 am to 11 am. The second meal was supper taken between 4 pm and 5 pm.

Here is a _very_ rudimentary illustration of the different medieval classes:

## _The Upper Crust_

As in all periods (including ours), the well-to-do liked to show off. During the medieval period that meant a show of what could be hunted and what could be purchased from exotic locations.\
Cookery itself was artful in its presentation, especially when it came to roasted dishes. Carving of meat was not a simple matter. Those who attended the King or Lord's table would need to be knowledgeable in the multitude of carving techniques for every animal. They also needed to know the correct terminologies for each carcass. For example, a heron would be "dismembered", while a baby rabbit (i.e. a coney) would be "unlaced". 

Prior to the Sumptuary Lawd of 1363 under Edward III, England had feasts with so many dishes in each course, that it would take a long time to list them all.

After the above law, a medieval table of a Lord during the times that the church did not require abstinence from meat, looked something like this:

Appetiser: Fruit such as plums, damsons, apples and cherries\
1st course: Meats in savoury sauces (5 different dishes)\
Intermediary: More fruit or nuts\
2nd course: Roasts (5 dishes again, anything from crane to baby rabbit, also heron or plover)\
3rd course: Small meats (5 dishes again, such as sparrows or curlew) together with baked quinces or fruit pottage or damsons in spiced wine\
Dessert: pears, strawberries, etc.\
Cheese\
Hippocras (spiced wine) and wafers

## _The Monks_

The monastery had a head, officers and average monks. This looked on the surface like a similar arrangement to the houses of Kings and Lords. However, the reality was that the leader of a monastery was not chosen by divine right (ironically), but by election. The same was true for the offices. All monks were equal until their positions changed.

It is also important to understand that at least in the High Middle Ages, monks came from the very upper crust they would go on to spiritually serve. This had consequences for their diet.

Technically, most monasteries were basing their rules on those laid out by St. Benedict in the 6th century. One of those rules was that no flesh from quadruplets shall be eaten (on the days in which fish isn't already the law).\
With the monks being used to eating meat on the daily, however, few wanted to abstain.

The rule was circumvented in two ways:\
a) Semantics - Benedict said that flesh of quadruplets shall not be eaten _within the refectory_ (the dining room), therefore, many monasteries simply build a second dining room, the misericord ("place of mercy"), in which they could indulge\
b) Offal - the Benedictine rule does not strictly forbid flesh from _inside_ a four-legged animal, thus, offal was seen as permissible. 

Pope Benedict XII (1334-42) eventually conceded to the problem and allowed offal and poultry to be eaten, and dictated that if at least 50% of monks ate at the refectory (and adhered to the meat-free rule), that would be in the spirit enough.

The monastic menu (on meat days) looked therefore something like this:

1st course: Beef. \
2nd course: Beef, pork, lamb, mutton, geese... with mutton being the most common

Both those courses would come with extras, for example, sheep entrails would be cooked in ale and breadcrumbs ("umble"), while minced meat would be mixed with eggs and milk ("charlet"). Cheese flan and custard were common in the refectory, and on meat-free days, it was fish for dinner and seafood such as cockles, for supper.

## _The Peasantry_

Peasants are not all one class. This is really true for all medieval people, but it is most obvious on this level.

Generalisation is still necessary, so we will divide it into two: the villeins and the freeman. 

A villeins too, was a complicated status. It was a bonded person who did not own her own land but cultivated the land of a Lord. Unlike slavery, however, villeinage was not the owning of a person per se, as much as a person being beholden to a piece of property. A villein could become a freemen and could not be sold.

So what did these classes eat?

Both classes will have a personal garden. Here they grow cabbages, beans and peas, onions and garlic, leeks, parsley and sage. It was also prudent to grow turnips, as they stored well, were nourishing to both humans and animals and therefore got a lot of people through food shortages. 

The better gardeners also had fruit trees. Apples were the most abundant, but pears, cherries, plums and damsons were also grown and favoured.

Those gardens provided the primary ingredients for the most common peasant meal: pottage.\
At its most basic, pottage is a stew made from meat stock, herbs, oats and salt. The meat stock did not mean a ready supply of meat - bones were generally used to make stock and this would be kept as long as possible.

The villeins in particular may have never tasted meat in her life.

The freemen on the other hand, may have wild fowl or an old hen that stopped laying. But generally, peasants will rather keep their animals for their better, more continuing purposes; Birds for eggs, sheep for wool, cows and goats for milk. Even freebies, such as the rare gift of fresh fish to the villein employed by his Lord as a fisherman, would likely rather sell the fish than eat it. (Fish was eaten by peasants, but not fresh. It would be consumed pickled or smoked, especially herring and sometimes cod.)

Back to the pottage! Virtually anything could be added to a pottage. Vegetables of all kinds were common, especially cabbage (it was believed that green vegetables were unhealthy for humans when unboiled). Thick pottages often had grains and almond milk added, while thin pottages were based on peas. 

With pottage, the peasant had bread. In the beginning of the High Middle Ages, dark rye bread would have dominated. Later a bread called "maslin", made from a mixture of rye and wheat, was available to the freeman. Breads based on oats or barley were also common. The villein would only have the coarsest rye bread to eat.

When bread became stale, it was converted into trenchers and bowls. The fluids from the food would soften the bread enough to either be eaten by people or given to the pigs.

The other animals may be given "horse bread", made of ground peas, beans and bran. In desperate times, this may also feed humans.

## _Famine_

Famines were still very common during the High Middle Ages. While crop failure would affect primarily the peasant class, sieges were a type of artificial famine that could even topple monks and the high-borne.

When crops failed, the rural population was the first to suffer. The King's primary supportive measure was to lower the grain import prices, but the rural peasants were simply not able to get to the city to buy grain (and even then, would have been unlikely to afford it). A two-year crop failure spelt death for entire families.

During famines, peasants ate anything digestible. Acorns, herbs and bark were some of the better ones, grass and darnel (a potentially fatal toxic weed resembling wheat) were of the more desperate kind. 

Medieval peasants' favourite time of the year was likely autumn. Vegetables, fruit and grain would be harvested in abundance and animals would be slaughtered to prevent having to feed them in the lean winter. Summer was alright too, as it meant more fish options.

But spring, while a welcome to signal the end of winter, also meant rain, and sometimes too much of it. During 1315, spring was so wet and multiple crop failures occured. The harvest did not recover until 1322 in some areas of Europe. The death toll was some 7,500,000 souls.
