Pliny the Elder is famous for having thought on and about virtually every plant and plant-like thing that one could conceivably imagine in his area of the world. 

I have a tiny vegetable and herb garden with common varieties and this will be an exploration of what Pliny has to say about them.

## Onions

_**Pliny's health advice: **_

+ a cure for **poor vision** through the tears caused by the smell

+ applying onion juice directly into the eye is even better

+ **soporific** (sleep-inducing)

+ heals **mouth sores** (when eaten with bread)

+ **healthy complexion** (when eaten)

+ **good health** (when eaten everyday on an empty stomach)

+ **moves gas** along

+ **disperse haemorrhoids** (when used as a suppository

+ against the early stages of **dropsy** \[edema] (onion juice mixed with an extract from fennel)

\
_**Pliny's entertaining anecdotes:**_ _Onions do not grow wild (!)_

## Lettuces

_**Pliny's health advice: **_

+ **soporific** (sleep-inducing

+ **cools a fever**ish body

+ **purge** the stomach

+ **increases blood volume**

+ disperses **flatulence**

+ suppresses **belches**

+ aids **digestion**

+ **stimulates _AND_ diminishes appetite**, depending on the amount (too much loosens the bowels, a moderate amount causes constipation)

_**Pliny's entertaining anecdotes: **_ _Lettuce can check sexual appetite (!)_

## Cabbages

_**Pliny's health advice: **_

+ **headaches**,** impaired vision**, **spots** before the eyes, **spleen** & stomach, **hypochondria** are cured by a mix of cabbage with oxymel (a mixture of raw honey, vinegar, and herbs), coriander, rue, mint, and silphium root (silphium is a now-extinct plant, likely from the Ferula family - it can be substituted with asafoetida) taken in the morning

+ fresh and old **wounds** and **malignant lesions** that cannot be healed with any other means, should be covered by pounded cabbage, stirred in hot water twice a day

+ **fistulas, tumors**, and **sprains** are to be treated the same way

+ **preventing dreams and insomnia** (when eaten with oil while otherwise fasting)

+ **improves eyesight** (when cabbage juice is mixed with Attic honey)

+ **paralysis**

+ **coughing up blood**

\
_**Pliny's entertaining anecdotes:**_

_The mixture to be taken in the morning for all sorts of ailments is said to make the person who makes it stronger (!)_ \[Cato]

_Due to cabbage being a bad companion to vines, cabbage prevents the wine drinker from getting drunk when they eat cabbage before consumption or neutralizes the intoxication if cabbage is eaten afterward (!)_ \[Greek common knowledge]
