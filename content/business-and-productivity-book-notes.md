A new quick summary series on books about business and productivity. It should be understood that these are not summaries per se, but notes of interest. I've read these books with personal business interest, so those notes might not have been those others would have found most interesting.

## NUDGE by Richard H. Thaler – _concerns human behaviour_

_Framing Effect_ – it is important HOW one says things. Saying that “ninety of one hundred patients are alive” is much more reassuring than “ten of one hundred are dead”. Framing works because people are passive decision makers. Thus frames are powerful nudges.

_Humans make mistakes_ – a well designed system  expects its users to err. Even illustrations may not work for mindless users. If users are used to doing something in a certain way (e.g. cars drive on the right!), it is important to give good and intuitive signage and/or feedback so people will become active.

_Online interactions help minorities and vulnerable groups_ – a study found that women and black people pay about the same as white males when buying cars online, but significantly more at a dealership, even when accounting for other factors such as income.

_Opt-In versus Opt-Out_ – explicit consent asks people to opt-in, presumed consent asks people to opt-out. People are much more likely to stay in a scenario if presumed consent is the default. E.g. organ donorship between Germany (explicit consent) & Austria (presumed consent) is 12% versus 99%. It is important to remember however, that even with presumed consent, the infrastructure to act upon this consent needs to exist and work well for it to be advantageous over explicit consent.
