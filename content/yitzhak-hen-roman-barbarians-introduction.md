Have you ever wondered what happened before crenellated castle walls and crusades? Why is the origin of the middle ages the least commonly talked about part? Turns out, there's a book!

This book is an academic take on the demarcation and continuity of the Roman era to the early medieval one. Due to the virtual absence of popular history books for the interested layman, my prior knowledge is nonexistent. But hey, ad altiora tendo.

This first chapter is a review of just why this era is so little talked about. As with all history, there are more questions than answers.

## *Introduction:* A Series of Unfortunate Events

The 3rd to the 8th century are commonly known as the Dark Ages. Hen starts us out by recounting the, until recently, commonly held view by historians that the time between the end of the Roman empire and the High Middle Ages was a sad limbo of decline and chaos. He points to Edward Gibbon's tome *"The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire"* (published between 1776â€“1789) for creating this view.

Swiftly, he moves on to show that this still pervasive view is not cannon anymore. The study of history has moved on and re-evaluated if Rome actually "fell" at all and if that was such a bad thing.
