## The Ming's Beginning

Prior to 1363, China was a Mongolian vassal. This changed with one man:  Zhu Yuanzhang (1328-1398). Zhu was a poor novice monk who had been orphaned early on. He had seen the devastation that foreign rule could cause (namely famines and uprisings) and decided to join a rebel group to initiate change.

Within five years, the Mongol rule was over.

Zhu's ambition was the restructuring of China, and he started with revitalising the agricultural landscape. Countless trees were planted (estimations say 1 billion mulberry trees, orchards and trees for shipbuilding in just 20 years), arable land cultivated and suplied with water and the income from grain tripled.

## Pre-Trump America

The USA has been famously successful in commerce, science, entertainment... all things that make a country a powerhouse. There were hiccups up surely, but by and large, the US was ever forward facing.

Until Donald John Trump announced his candidacy for president in June 2015.

## Insularity as a Trauma Response

The emperor, who would choose the name Hóngwǔ ("vastly martial"), could not forget his disdain for those who did not fight against the Mongols, so he created a regime that was absolutist. Personnel were executed on mere suspicion of disloyalty, and all ministries were to report directly to and through him.

Hóngwǔ wanted an orderly society, and the simplest way was by caste. He classified people into soliders (a category especially important to him), farmers and merchants, with separatly assigned settlements and tax classes. People were not to change jobs and settled area and that was meant to be overseen by officials. 

There weren't enough officials to control everything and soon the tax income looked disjointed.

Especially the solider class proved problematic. Soldiers were meant to be born into their job - without considerations for predilection to the task. There was also no military budget, instead land was set aside which the solider class was meant to use for their survival. \
Wealthier solider quickly used the land as their freehold and made younger and poorer soliders work their land. They also removed themselves from active duty by paying poorer soliders to fight in their stead. Many also simply deserted.

To hasten the empires issues, Zhu had also allowed for eunuchs, who lived in the palace in order to help the harems of the emperor, to come to prominent positions, which greatly irked the officials who came from wealthy backgrounds and did not want to compete with the poor servants. Zhu had experienced poverty and the disdain for the poor by the rich
