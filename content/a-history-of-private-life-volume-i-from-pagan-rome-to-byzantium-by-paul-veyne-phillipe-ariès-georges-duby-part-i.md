_There are a lot of books about Roman history. The topic is one of the most popular ones, even among people who have only a cursory interest in history. However, many history books suffer from 'lecture syndrome', in which they simply state the progression of events, or they are opinion pieces that do not age well._

_This book is different. It takes aspects of Roman life and examines them from a factual, social, and philosophical perspective. _

_I will summarise those parts of the book that made me go "huh!"._

## SCHOOL

The authors made an interesting distinction between Roman and Greek syllabi. The major difference between these two educations was that sport took up half of the study time of the Greek student. 

The schedule also included the study of Greek, Homer, Rhetoric, a little Philosophy, and a lot of Music. School lasted for 16 years and was immediately followed by two more years. 

Interesting quote from this section:

> _" \[...] teacher of literature they studied classical authors and mythology (of which they believed not a word, but knowledge of mythology was the mark of a cultured person)."_

## ADOLESCENCE

Civic and professional matters were learned on the job, while culture was studied in school. What a reversal compared to today!

## YOUTH

This chapter contained an interesting nod to Tacitus, who was a Roman historian and famously wrote _Germania_, one of the best sources for the Germanic tribal culture of the day. He comments on the differences between Roman attitudes to youthful dalliances, and Germanic customs. The fact that Tacitus felt compelled to comment on this, maybe due to changing feelings in light of the rise of stoicism.

The authors quote Tacitus: 

> "_\[The Germans] know love only late in life, so that the strength of youth in them is not drained."_
