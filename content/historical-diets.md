Diets have and still differ between eras and countries. It isn't always easy to imagine how our ancestors managed - but did they eat better than us? Let's find out!

## Paleolithic

## China

## Aztecs & Mayans

## Egyptians & Mesopotamians

## Romans & Greeks

## Middle Ages

The Middle Ages technically comprise three eras. While the early Middle Ages were still reminiscent of the Pagan age that preceded it, and the attitudes towards communal eating, the High Middle Ages were strictly separated affairs. During the late medieval period, the norms changed again. 

Those of high rank (nobles and the clergy) had different allowances and habits than the workers. It was believed that this separation was natural to the point, that the higher-ranking members of society had a naturally more sensitive disposition. \
Coarse bread and simple pottage were fare not tolerated by the upper crust.

I will focus on the High Middle Ages (AD 1000 to 1300) and central and western Europe.

## _The Upper Crust_

As in all periods (including ours), the well-to-do liked to show off. During the medieval period that meant a show of what could be hunted and what could be purchased from exotic locations.\
Cookery itself was artful in its presentation, especially when it came to roasted dishes. Carving of meat was not a simple matter. Those who attended the King or Lord's table would need to be knowledgeable in the multitude of carving techniques for every animal. They also needed to know the correct terminologies for each carcass. For example, a heron would be "dismembered", while a baby rabbit (i.e. a coney) would be "unlaced". 

Prior to the Sumptuary Lawd of 1363 under Edward III, England had feasts with so many dishes in each course, that it would take a long time to list them all.

After the above law, a medieval table of a Lord during the times that the church did not require abstinence from meat, looked something like this:

Appetiser: Fruit such as plums, damsons, apples and cherries\
1st course: Meats in savoury sauces (5 different dishes)\
Intermediary: More fruit or nuts\
2nd course: Roasts (5 dishes again, anything from crane to baby rabbit, also heron or plover)\
3rd course: Small meats (5 dishes again, such as sparrows or curlew) together with baked quinces or fruit pottage or damsons in spiced wine\
Dessert: pears, strawberries, etc.\
Cheese\
Hippocras (spiced wine) and wafers
