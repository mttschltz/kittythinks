# *CH. IV - Building Your Portfolio*

By age 25, you should be saving about 10% of your income. If you are already 45, you need to save 50% of your income. (Or just start earlier.)

To be "safe", you can spend 2% of your nest-egg. For example: If one needs $50.000 p.a. to live, to be secure, one has to have saved $2.5 million.
