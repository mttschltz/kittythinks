# THE MAN OF LAW

*Characters:*

- **Aella** - a king
- **Donegild** - mother of Aella
- **Constance** - wife of Aella
- **Emperor of Rome** - Constance's father
- **Maurice** - son of Constance & Aella
- **Sultan** - wants Constance
- **Sultan's mother** - does not want Constance
- **Constable** - a good man
- **Hermengild** - Constable's good wife
- **Senator & Wife** - Roman versions of Constable & Hermengild
- **Knight** - a misguided man

The **Sultan** of Syria has gotten word of the beauty of the daughter of the **Emperor of Rome**, **Constance**. Their opposing religions forbid such a union, so the **Sultan** converts to Christianity.

The **Sultan's mother** is against the union and kills all Christians on her son's wedding.

**Constance** is put on a ship and cast out to sea. After many years, she lands in Northumberland.

She is taken in by a pagan **Constable** and his wife, **Hermengild** (both promptly convert to Christianity).

A **knight** falls in love with **Constance**. Upon being refused, the knight kills **Hermengild** and places the knife in such a way that it appears **Constance** was the killer. 

To prove his accusations, the **knight** must swear on the Gospel. He is instantly struck and his eyes explode. 

**Constance** is made a queen to the king of the land, **Aella** and falls pregnant. 

While **Aella** is at war,  letter is to be send to him about the birth of his son, **Maurice**. **Donegild**, Aella's mother, dislikes **Constance** and intercepts the letter. She exchanges it for one that states the child to be born a monster, clearly because the mother is an elf.

**Aella** is distraught but content. He writes back that the mother and child are to be protected. The letter is once again intercepted and **Constance** and **Maurice** are put back on the ship she came one and send off to sea once more.

After many more years at sea, the **senator** to the **Emperor of Rome** finds **Constance**, not knowing who she is. He takes her in. **Constance** and **Maurice** stay there for a long time.

Meanwhile, **Aella** has killed his mother, but now feels guilty for his matricide. He travels to Rome to seek penance.

The **senator** hears of this and, with **Maurice**, goes to meet **Aella**. The king sees the resemblance in **Constance** and **Maurice** and soon, **Aella** and **Constance** and reunited.

**Constance** begs **Aella** to dine with her father, the **Emperor**. All is well!

Except, **Aella** dies after only a year, **Constance** goes to live out her days with her father and **Maurice** becomes Emperor.

*"We women are born to servitude and penance, Always ruled by some men's governance."*

# THE SHIPMAN

*Characters:*

- **Merchant** - a cockhold
- **Wife** - a trickster
- **Don John** - a impious monk

A **merchant** invites his friend, a monk to visit. On day three, the **merchant** leaves to attend to his finances.

The merchant's **wife** laments to **Don John** that she is short on funds and wants him to give her 100 francs.

**Don John** asks the merchant for 100 francs and gets them. He gives the 100 francs to the **wife** and asks for sex as payment.

When the **merchant** gets back, he is in debt and goes to **Don John** to ask what became of the 100 francs. **Don John** tells him he gave the 100 francs to the merchant's **wife** for save-keeping.

Upon confronting his **wife**, the **merchant** gets told that she believed the money to be her payment for her hospitality and that she will repay him in the  bedroom.

*"And you know that women naturally desire the same six things as I; they want their husbands to be brave, wise rich, generous with money, obedient to the wife and lievly in the bedroom."
