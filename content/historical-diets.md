Diets have and still differ between eras and countries. It isn't always easy to imagine how our ancestors managed - but did they eat better than us? Let's find out!

## Romans & Greeks

## Middle Ages

The Middle Ages technically comprise three eras. While the early Middle Ages were still reminiscent of the Pagan age that preceded it, and the attitudes towards communal eating, the High Middle Ages were strictly separated affairs. During the late medieval period, the norms changed again. 

Those of high rank (nobles and the clergy) had different allowances and habits than the workers. It was believed that this separation was natural to the point, that the higher-ranking members of society had a naturally more sensitive disposition. \
Coarse bread and simple pottage were fare not tolerated by the upper crust.

I will focus on the High Middle Ages (AD 1000 to 1300) and central and western Europe.

To start of, the medieval era tended to eat two meals and no snacks. IF breakfast was eaten (by the rich who had the time or the better-off when planning a very long horse ride), it was bread and cheese. 

The more common first meal was dinner. This was consumed at around 10 am to 11 am. The second meal was supper taken between 4 pm and 5 pm.

## _The Upper Crust_

As in all periods (including ours), the well-to-do liked to show off. During the medieval period that meant a show of what could be hunted and what could be purchased from exotic locations.\
Cookery itself was artful in its presentation, especially when it came to roasted dishes. Carving of meat was not a simple matter. Those who attended the King or Lord's table would need to be knowledgeable in the multitude of carving techniques for every animal. They also needed to know the correct terminologies for each carcass. For example, a heron would be "dismembered", while a baby rabbit (i.e. a coney) would be "unlaced". 

Prior to the Sumptuary Lawd of 1363 under Edward III, England had feasts with so many dishes in each course, that it would take a long time to list them all.

After the above law, a medieval table of a Lord during the times that the church did not require abstinence from meat, looked something like this:

Appetiser: Fruit such as plums, damsons, apples and cherries\
1st course: Meats in savoury sauces (5 different dishes)\
Intermediary: More fruit or nuts\
2nd course: Roasts (5 dishes again, anything from crane to baby rabbit, also heron or plover)\
3rd course: Small meats (5 dishes again, such as sparrows or curlew) together with baked quinces or fruit pottage or damsons in spiced wine\
Dessert: pears, strawberries, etc.\
Cheese\
Hippocras (spiced wine) and wafers

## _The Monks_

The monastery had a head, officers and average monks. This looked on the surface like a similar arrangement to the houses of Kings and Lords. However, the reality was that the leader of a monastery was not chosen by divine right (ironically), but by election. The same was true for the offices. All monks were equal until their positions changed.

It is also important to understand that at least in the High Middle Ages, monks came from the very upper crust they would go on to spiritually serve. This had consequences for their diet.

Technically, most monasteries were basing their rules on those laid out by St. Benedict in the 6th century. One of those rules was that no flesh from quadruplets shall be eaten (on the days in which fish isn't already the law).\
With the monks being used to eating meat on the daily, however, few wanted to abstain.

The rule was circumvented in two ways:\
a) Semantics - Benedict said that flesh of quadruplets shall not be eaten _within the refectory_ (the dining room), therefore, many monasteries simply build a second dining room, the misericord ("place of mercy"), in which they could indulge\
b) Offal - the Benedictine rule does not strictly forbid flesh from _inside_ a four-legged animal, thus, offal was seen as permissible. 

Pope Benedict XII (1334-42) eventually conceded to the problem and allowed offal and poultry to be eaten, and dictated that if at least 50% of monks ate at the refectory (and adhered to the meat-free rule), that would be in the spirit enough.

The monastic menu (on meat days) looked therefore something like this:

1st course: Beef. \
2nd course: Beef, pork, lamb, mutton, geese... with mutton being the most common

Both those courses would come with extras, for example, sheep entrails would be cooked in ale and breadcrumbs ("umble"), while minced meat would be mixed with eggs and milk ("charlet"). Cheese flan and custard were common in the refectory, and on meat-free days, it was fish for dinner and seafood such as cockles, for supper.

## _The Peasantry_

Peasants are not all one class. This is really true for all medieval people, but it is most obvious on this level.

Generalisation is still necessary, so we will divide into three: the slave, the villeins and the yeoman.

## _Famine_

Famines were still very common during the High Middle Ages. While crop failure would affect primarily the peasant class, sieges were a type of artificial famine that could even topple monks and the high-borne.

When crops failed, the rural population was the first to suffer. The King's primary supportive measure was to lower the grain import prices, but the rural peasants were simply not able to get to the city to buy grain (and even then, would have been unlikely to afford it). A two-year crop failure spelt death for entire families.

During famines, peasants ate anything digestible. Acorns, herbs and bark were some of the better ones, grass and darnel (a potentially fatal toxic weed resembling wheat) were of the more desperate kind. 

Medieval peasants' favourite time of the year was likely autumn. Vegetables, fruit and grain would be harvested in abundance and animals would be slaughtered to prevent having to feed them in the lean winter. Summer was alright too, as it meant more fish options.

But spring, while a welcome to signal the end of winter, also meant rain, and sometimes too much of it. During 1315, spring was so wet and multiple crop failures occured. The harvest did not recover until 1322 in some areas of Europe. The death toll was some 7,500,000 souls.
