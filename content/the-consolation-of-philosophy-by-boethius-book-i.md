Boethius is writing this iconic neoplatonic work (generally considered the last great work of the Classical Period) while imprisoned for treason. He is condemned to death._

## The Consolation of Philosophy - Book I

A poem describing the vows of ageing and the shackles of imprisonment. Boethius is surrounded by muses, aiding him in grieving when a woman appears to him. She is clearly magical in nature: draped in a dress embroidered with the letters Π (pi, for practice) and Θ (theta, for theory), with books in her right hand and a scepter in her left.

The mysterious woman is not at all amused about the presence of the muses, they provide but "intemperate passion" instead of reason - an educated man like Boethius does not need emotional turmoil throwing him into depression, he needs reason to heal himself.

Boethius used to be a patron of the sciences and after the woman has dried his tears, he realizes who he is seeing: it is Philosophy. Boethius is reluctant to accept her presence - the charges against him went also against his virtues, against Philosophy itself.

Lady Philosophy is not worried. She has been squabbled over many times, by the Epicureans and the Stoics alike. All tore at her dress, and claimed the pieces taken made the whole garment.

> "I have been doing battle forever against proud stupidity."

Anger is helpless, fear pointless and desire delusional. Boethius is fickle in his state and is forging the chains that shackle him.

He is not responsive. He is in a cell, not at home, what good is Philosophy to him?

He had tried to do as Plato modeled and go into politics to implement reason and imprisonment was his thanks! How could he not lament his misfortune, being so falsely accused.

Boethius wonders: if there is a god, how is there evil? And if there isn't a god, how is there good?
