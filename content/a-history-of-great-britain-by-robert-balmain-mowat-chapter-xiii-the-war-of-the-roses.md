# CHAPTER XIII - The War of the Roses

_The Lead-Up_

The Hundred Years' War has drained Britain's morale. Military forces have become disillusioned. Many nobles have put returning men-at-arms in livery, i.e. on payroll, like household servants. To identify a solider as belonging to a lord, a badge is sewn unto his cloak.
