A Square goes on vacation.

He tells us of a dreaming vision of Lineland. 
Lineland is a one-dimensional universe in which everything is moving in a line.

There are lines of varying sizes and dots, all seemingly moving at the same velocity. They chirrup. 

Square decides to ask one of the lines to explain herself. He gets no reaction at first but, upon increasing demand and turning himself, gets the answer he wishes: He is not talking to a woman, lines in Flatland, but to a man and this man is king of Lineland.

The king explains that all Linelanders see but dots. Men, women, objects, all appear as such. Yet, he knows that he is a line and women or dots, because all Lineland men have two mouths and eyes, while women only have one.

Men's two mouths produce two voices, one a bass and one a tenor. Women are either sopranos or contraltos. So it is that all Lineland men take two wives, one matching harmoniously to each of their voices.

Once a week, all Linelanders feel compelled to move rhythmically from side to side for 100 paces. On the 51 pulsation, they stop and take up a melodious cry heard throughout Lineland. 

If two female Linelanders match in harmony with one male Linelander, they are at once a married threesome and their marriage is consummated, no  matter their distance on line.

One of the women will bear twin girls and the other a single boy. This is how Linelands population is maintained.

A Square wonders how the men know they are not deceived by women (or men), since they cannot tell who is who. The king is not amused by Square's ignorance but explains that they recognize each other through _hearing_
