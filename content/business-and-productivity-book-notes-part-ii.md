## MODERN MONOPOLIES by Ale Moazed & Nicholas L. Johnson – _concerns platform businesses_

![null](/images/uploads/monopolies.jpg)

While the internet is open, every activity has to go through a** platform**.

The old business model – Product/Service = Distribution = Customer

The new platform business model – _consumer and producer are the same and work through a platform_.

Platforms create the means of connection.

Core transactions of a platform:

(1) **Audience building**

(2) **Matchmaking**

(3) Providing **core tool and services**

(4) Setting **rules and standards**

_Capitalism and competition are opposites._

What provides defensibility against copycats? _Networks of users, transactions or data_.

_Unicorn Company_ – a company valued at more than US$1 billion.

Platforms become more efficient the larger they become.\
Expenses don’t grow as fast as revenue does at this point.

_Short-term goals_: user acquisition and expansion.\
_Long-term goals_: user retention and diminishing funds

_Network value_ – is value users derive from other people’s use of a platform.

Revenue avenues have to be adapted to **what devices users use most**.

_Core transaction_ – platforms need their users to repeat core transactions over and over. 

Core transaction for _Exchange Platforms_ (e.g. etsy, ebay) – use a double opt-in: both parties have to agree to exchange at **that** moment.

Focusing on ONE core transaction first, makes success more likely.

There is currently no good troll and harassment tool available.

Create a lightweight platform as quickly as possible to gather feedback and see if the idea works. Modify later.

Sustainable networks > vanity metrics (e.g. amount of users)

Potential new users are driven by an attraction to an existing user base.

Attract marquee users in the beginning to uphold a certain quality.

If one’s platform business ISN’T under scrutiny by law – maybe it isn’t big enough of an idea.

Could your business sell virtual goods?

Remove transaction costs – money, time OR effort.

Use under-served markets.

Large supply, that isn’t connected, is important.
