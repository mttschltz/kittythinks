 Pliny the Elder is famous for having thought on and about virtually every plant and plant-like thing that one could conceivably imagine in his area of the world. 

I have a tiny vegetable and herb garden with common varieties and this will be an exploration of what Pliny has to say about them.

## Onions

Pliny's health advice: 

+ a cure for **poor vision** through the tears caused by the smell\
+ applying onion juice directly into the eye is even better\
+ **soporific** (sleep-inducing\
+ heals **mouth sores** (when eaten with bread)\
+ **healthy complexion** (when eaten)\
+ **good health** (when eaten everyday on an empty stomach)\
+ **moves gas** along\
+ **disperse haemorrhoids** (when used as a suppository\
+ against the early stages of **dropsy** \[edema] (onion juice mixed with an extract from fennel)

\
Pliny's entertaining opinions: Onion do not grow wild (!)



People are places Pliny mentions: [Asclepiades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asclepiades_of_Bithynia)
