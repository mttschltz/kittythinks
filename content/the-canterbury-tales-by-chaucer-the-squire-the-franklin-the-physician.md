# THE SQUIRE

* **Cambiuskan** - a king
* **Elpheta** - a queen
* **Algarsyf & Cambalo** - princes
* **Canace** - a princess
* **Knight** - a messenger
* **Falconess** - a betrayed one

On the birthday of king **Cambiuskan**, a strange knight appears and bears gifts from the kings of Arabia and India.

There is a magic flying horse made of brass, a sword that can kill and heal, a fortune-telling mirror, and a ring that makes the wearer understand birds and know herbs.

The next morning, **Canace** wears the magic ring and takes a walk. She comes upon a **falcones**s that had been betrayed by a kite. 

**Canace** takes her in and tends to her wounds...

# THE FRANKLIN

* Arveragus - a honourable knight
* Dorigen - a faithful woman
* Aurelius - a goodhearted fool
* Magician - a forgiven soul

Arveragus is married to Dorigen. The only thing he asked her on their wedding was to respect his position of honour.

When Arveragus goes off to war, Aurelius, a squire, tries to woo Dorigen. 

She is not interested and tells him he only has a chance if he removes the black rocks on the coast from her sight.

Aurelius finds a magician and for £1000, he will make an illusion which remove the rocks.

When Arveragus comes back, the distraught Dorigen tells her of her unfortunate vow.

Arveragus decides that Dorigen must honour her vow.

When Aurelius realizes how reluctant Dorigen is and how honourable Arveragus, he changes his mind and lets the two be.

Aurelius is now broke and wifeless.

When the magician sees the selflessness of all three, he decides to waive the fee.
