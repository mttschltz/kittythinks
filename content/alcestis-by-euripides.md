# Story

Apollo, the god of healing and truth, is punished by Zeus for killing the Cyclops. Apollo had reason for his anger - Zeus killed his son! Nevertheless, he is now to live as a mortal craftsman in Thessaly. Thessaly's minor kingdom Pherae is ruled by Admetus, a just king, who has befriended Apollo.

When Admetus is fated to die, Apollo bargains with Death for his release in lieu of a willing replacement. Admetus asks his aging father and mother but they both refuse. His loyal wife, Alcestis however, commits herself in his stead.

When Death comes for Alcestis and finds Apollo, he is outraged. Does Apollo want to rob him of another just sacrifice? Apollo indeed tries to argue with Death that he could just as well wait until he is aged, but Death refuses. Apollo, unused to being refused, sends for a hero who shall match Death in its harshness.

The Chorus of Pheraean citizens wonders if Alcestis is really fated to die. Would Admetus really sacrifice his loving wife? They tell the tale of Alcestis getting ready for her death, how she washed and preened, how she wept on her marriage bed and how she, ever the gracious woman, said tearful goodbyes to her children and servants.

All she wants before she passes, is to see the golden sunlight one last time. Admetus obligingly leads his dying wife outside. Alcestis now dying asks of her husband but one thing: he shall never remarry, for the sake of their children. Admetus agrees gravely - he is distraught.

> One who is dead is nothing. Time will soften pain.
