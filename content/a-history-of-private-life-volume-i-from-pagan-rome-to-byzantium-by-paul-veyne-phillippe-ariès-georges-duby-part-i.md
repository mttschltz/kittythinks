Roman history is uniquely popular with even the most cursory enthusiast of history. However, a lot of history books are either simply a collection of post-its (_"This happened, and then this happened..."_) or author's opinion pieces.

This book is different. It examines the aspects of Roman life that require interpretation from a social and philosophical standpoint.
