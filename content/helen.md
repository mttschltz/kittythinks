**Story**

Helen is in Egypt. She tells of her unusual origins. Zeus had raped her mother, Leda, while disguised as a swan. This divine descent made Helen a great beauty. All Zeus's daughters, Aphrodite, Hera and Athene, were beautiful, and in a fight over which was the prettiest, Aphrodite secures the win by bargaining Helen to Paris, a son of the king of Troy. 

Helen's husband, Menelaus, believes her to be in Troy with Paris. He sails to find her and will start the Troyan War due to believing her to have willingly gone, this will make Helen reviled throughout Greece. Helen however, is not actually there - Zeus has put her into the palace of Proteus in Egypt. In her stead, Zeus has sent an illusion to Troy.

When Proteus dies, his son Theoclymenus inherits the throne and wants to marry Helen.

Teucer, a Greek, has come to Egypt and upon seeing Helen is initially enraged. He is a reasonable man however, and realized that this can not be the same Helen of Troy. Teucer tells Helen that Menelaus is presumed dead. Her mother and brother have died as well. Helen is distraught.

> _"To save my life I can choose to marry Theoclymenus, \[...]. But an odious husband makes even wealth odious. The wirsest course is - to die."_
