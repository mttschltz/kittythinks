Plants can heal and plants can kill. 
Mythology, history and cryptobotany has also produced plants that can do much more.
This is an overview of a small selection of mythtical plants, what they are, what they can do, how to get them and if there might be some reality behind the myth!

# Yggdrasil

**Origin Story**
In Norse mythology, trees play a central role. After the gods kill the giant Ymir, they make of him all things; the first tree made is Yggdrasil. Yggdrasil is the tree that connects the (nine) worlds. It has three roots, leading to different wells and a spring. Creatures live in it (such as a dragon) and the Æsir (the pantheon of Norse gods), hold 'things' - the Germanic word for court hearings - at its base.

Yggdrasil is assumed to be an ash tree. However, there are numerous examples of venerated trees of other origin, such as oaks. There is some debate that Yggdrasil may have actually been a yew tree. This idea comes from the mention that Yggdrasil is "evergreen". The only evergreen tree in this part of the world (Scandinavia) at the time of the writing of the Edda, was the yew tree. 

**What the plant can do**
Yggdrasil can bring forth beings such as the Norns, the three women who decide the fate of humankind. In the 20th stanza of the Völuspá poem of the Poetic Edda, it also speaks of Yggdrasil bringing froth a giant. 

> _Yggdrasill shivers,
> the ash, as it stands.
> The old tree groans,
> and the giant slips free._

Furthermore, dew falls from the tree, making 'honeydew' that feeds the bees.

**How to procure it**
To get to Yggdrasil, one must travel via Bifröst (the bridge of the gods) and the tree cannot be taken as it connects the worlds. If the tree decays, so does the world.

**Is it real?** 
Probably not. We have too much evidence that the word isn't held up by a tree.

# Barnacle Tree

**Origin Story**
Spontaneous evolution, the idea that an organism could originate without similar organisms, was a commonly believed hypothesis from antiquity to the mid-19th century. The idea of a tree bearing seashells and ultimately birds was reported and accepted in the Middle Ages until the 18th century. 

**What the plant can do**
The tree grows elongated barnacles, which in time will split open and reveal the legs of a bird. Slowly, the bird will mature and hang on the tree by its bill - then drop into the sea. "_\[...] where it gathereth feathers, and groweth to a foule, bigger than a Mallard, and lesser than a Goose_." (John Gerard in his Herball, or Generall Historie of Plantes, published in 1597). 

The described bird is likely the Barnacle goose (Branta leicopsis), which, due to this myth, was considered "not of flesh" and thus eligible to be eaten on days in which meat was forbidden in Christianity. However, emperor Frederick II was highly sceptical of the origin story and put out when he was served the goose on a fast-day in 1456.

**How to procure it**
Found in Britain, most likely in the coastal areas in Lancashire. 

**Is it real?**
MAYBE! 
A couple in Cornwall found one barnacle tree (sans baby birds) in 2011 and photographed it. The tree does indeed have goose barnacles (_Lepas anatifera_) on it.
