# THE KNIGHT

*Characters*:

- **Theseus** - a duke
- **Arcite**  - a knight
- **Palamon** - a knight
- **Emily**   - Theseus's sister-in-law

**Theseus** conquers Scythia and two knights are captured: **Arcite** and **Palamon**. The two knights become enamored by Theseus' sister-in-law, **Emily**.

**Arcite** gets freed but exiled, he is inconsolable that he is parted from **Emily**, while **Palamon** is inconsolable that he is imprisoned.

**Arcite** disguises himself of a lowly servant to work for **Theseus**. Meanwhile, **Palamon** escapes and plans to attack **Theseus** with an army.

**Palamon** and **Arcite** meet by chance and plan to fight each other over **Emily**, but **Theseus** decides that they should have a proper tournament.

**Palamon** loses but **Arcite** is badly injured. Upon his death, he commands that **Palamon** must marry **Emily**. 

**Theseus**, to unite the lands, eventually agrees and they are married, as was foretold.

*"Just as no man ever died, who had not to some extent lived on earth, so no man ever lived in this word who is not at some time destined to die."*

# THE MILLER

*Characters:*

- **Carpenter** - a husband
- **Alison** - a wife
- **Nicholas** - a trickster cleric
- **Absolom** - a tricked cleric

A **carpenter** takes in two lodgers, **Nicholas** and **Absolom**. **Nicholas** and **Absolom** are both propositioning **Alison**, the **carpenter**'s wife. She is interested in **Nicholas**.

To lie with **Alison**, **Nicholas** tells the **carpenter** that a new flood will come and he must fashion three barrels, one for each of them and suspend them from the ceiling. While the **carpenter** sleeps in his barrel, **Alison** and **Nicholas** get it on.

**Absolom** wants in on the action and asks **Alison** for a kiss. Instead of her mouth, she presents her arse and **Absolom** is shamed.

For his revenge, **Absolom** acquires a hot poker and asks again for a kiss. 

This time, **Nicholas** presents his behind and farts in **Absolom**'s face. **Absolom** strikes **Nicholas**'s backside and **Nicholas** cries for water. This wakes the **carpenter**, he cuts the rope of his barrel and falls to the ground, unconscious.

The neighbours all come and laugh.

And so, the **carpenter** was made a cuckhold, **Absolom** kissed **Alison**'s arse and **Nicholas** was scorched.

*"Men can die of imagination, so deep may impressions be made upon them."*

# THE REEVE

*Characters:*

- **Simkin** - a miller
- **Wife** - of the miller
- **Daughter** - of the miller
- **John** - a student
- **Allan** - a student

**John** and **Allan** are not happy with the shady business **Simkin** the miller is conducting. They try to trick the miller into revealing his misconduct but fail. They also lost their horse and need food and lodging.

After a night of drunkeness, all occupants of the miller's house go to bed.

**Allan** decides he deserves sex with Simkin's **daughter** and promptly rapes her. **John** now jealous, takes a cradle (with a baby) and positions it in front of his own bed. When Simkin's **wife** awakes at night to relieve herself, she searches for the cradle to find her bed and gets in it. **John** rapes her.

Now worried, still in the dark, **Allan** gets up to get in bed with **John**. When he feels the cradle, he assumes it to be the wrong bed and tries the next one. Thinking he is lying with **John**, he tells him of his exploits with the **daughter**.

**Simkin** awakes and a fight ensues but in the dark the miller's **wife**, confused, beats at the first person. This person was **Simkin** and he is now unconcious. 

**Allan** and **John** leave, having won it all.

*"He who does evil must not expect good."*
